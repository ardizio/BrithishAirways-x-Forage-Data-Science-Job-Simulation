I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name "BudgetThe people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth, honest hard working peopleThe actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly - and helpfulThe interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxuriousThank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels"Cattle class" was definitely that! To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatementIt is, however, with thanks to a supervisor from Business Class check in, who came to our assistance and help with our predicament- baggage retrieval, information on what to claimExcellent service levels, proactive crew and superb food and beveragesI found all aspects of the service to be superior to BA business class, even the new BA Club SuitesFirst Class felt exclusive, the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin, enjoying their work, were proactive, friendly, very respectful and the food and beverage offering aconsiderable step up from business classThe seat, with sliding double doors was spacious, well designed and very comfortableBritish Airways offered a solid First Class service, from Concorde Lounge to boarding (which was actually by group number for a change) to the very warm and genuine welcome onA consistent, solid, comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right, I would not hesitate to book First Class with British Airways again.Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both tostart the holiday rightOur short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived earlyBritish Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakesThe funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to AmsterdamThe flight actually left on time! I came to find out that\xe2\x80\x99s very unusualThen we got to Heathrow and the real fun beganFinally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next dayMy wife and I used the Galleries North lounge and at 6-00am it was easy to get a seatGood buffet breakfast optionsFlight boarded on time and flight departed on timeCabin Crew service was fineFlight landed on timeUpon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order, which they assured me is correctThis was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could doWhilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate, getting to board before anyone else! However, the service on board was impeccableSuperb crew, friendly, attentive, interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their jobLike BA in the old days and at its bestFood choice and quality seems to have improved too (no beef cheeks thankfully) and even the Club kitchen appears to have returnedOld style Club seating, but is at least better, and feels less cramped, on the 787\'s.British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flightsBut when it worked it was surprisingly fastService on this flight was very good and we got to Keflavik on time.They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I\'ve seen on airplanesBA\'s new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivalsThere was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging appsThe food was alright and no moreThe biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights takeThe airport experience is far more pleasant at this timeIn summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product.trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer.First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnelNice flight, good crew, very good seat, food was what you would expectThere were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and workedThe video system worked great and had plenty of contentThe crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have hadLHR is what it is, crowded and expansive but we had a good lounge visit and were completely on time for all flights.Ground and cabin crew always provide good customer serviceOnboard I sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuffThe food for dinner was decent, they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standardsThe seat was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smoothus free bus tickets to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room, and gave us Dinner and Breakfast vouchersGreat customer service!Flight boarded smoothly and on timeCabin crew were all fantasticFood and drink options were all very goodEntertainment was goodOverall an enjoyable flight.Good domestic flight operated by BA CityflyerGround service at check-in Edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpfulGenerally it seems that the quality of the Cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline British Airways flights.I had the most fantastic BA Flight todayThe cabin crew in my seat zone 6D were of the best I have experiencedAlthough the 777 had the old style rear/front seating - it was comfortable and felt open and spaciousBA have done great things with the menu - it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local time havingThe dinner offering was equally ample and deliciousThe inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first ratePreviously not a huge BA fan - but after this 12 hour flight I could only recommend it without reserveI flew the new BA suite in J class on a recent Delhi to London flight and enjoyed that product (although I felt it slightly more cramped ) but Ithink BA have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best wayVery helpful Gatwick staff got us a bus to LHR and a flight to ToulouseThe lounge near Terminal 5, Gate B36 at Heathrow was outstanding in its service and offeringsNot the best in class but comfortable enoughI hear that the new Club Suites configuration is far superiorBritish Airways onboard service was outstanding in every respectAll in all, a very comfortable flightWe got into Mumbai at 8 am, a civilized time to arrive.The boarding process was well handledWhat made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight WiFiI chose British Airways especially because I was going to travel with my niece and nephew, and wanted everything to work wellFinally we could access the planeFair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the differenceIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be Eurostar for me next time.Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick)The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wineOn board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the "chocolate and orange pot" that seems to appear on every flight - have they boughtup the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarmThe inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself asA fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better onAnother really great pair of flights, on time, no problems at all, champagne was ok and my meal choices were great, the new club suite is a good improvement overthe previous seat, in flight entertainment could have been better, can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to fly with BA again and enjoy another great experience.They used to be a really good airline to fly withFor us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, whenWe got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmostWhen we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying toThe breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at allThe previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasureThe seats are wide and there is ample legroomHowever I was thankful that there was no reclineNo IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendlyWe have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in IcelandI have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experienceEconomy was excellentThe flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good jobThis is a flight I would recommendThe only real plus is ChampagneThe cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the businessSo great flight but stick with economy.Both flights departed on timeFlights OK - FA\'s (particularly on return flight) pleasant enoughThe staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there.I\xe2\x80\x99ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuffMy onward flight was with LATAM, same 787 aircraft but more room between rows, far more comfortableI booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco2/10 for the kind personnel that\'s holding this airline together though.An excellent flight in Club World on British AirwaysThe welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flightThe crew were attentive, friendly and very professionalOn board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of winesIn flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audioThe seat/flat bed was very comfortable - British Airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the A350I liked the sleek, minimalist designThis flight showed that BA can be among the world\xe2\x80\x99s best airlines.I informed the crew and they helped me outThankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until I returned back homeIt was a stressful experience but the crew of British Airways made it way more tolerable.Flight left on time, very professional crew, greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return customA nice touchService was goodEntertainment goodAll good.When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experienceEasy check in on the way to HeathrowThe flight was on time with no issuesWe had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutesThat is indeed customer serviceThank you.Online check in worked fineAll in all very pleasedCheap, quick and efficient.Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this businessThe cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyableBoarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional tableI think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frillsI was glad it was only a two hour flightMakes easyJet and Ryanair look like customer championsThe Staff were efficientmade our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodationsThe crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every timeI say this as the new club suites are great.I acceptedbetterRegarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty goodThe seat is pretty comfortableThe leather toiletry bag was quite nice thoughThe bread was nice thoughnight and asked to go search for a hotel on your own, very nice of you British AirwaysSecond time BA Premium Economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experienceDespite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flightSeats are spacious and comfortable in Premium Economy in this layout, attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was goodThey communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mindA very pleasant experience in BA Premium Economy after a major disappointment in Club World earlier this year.Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotelI will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentiveThe First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet availableare better and cleaner)Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins lateGround staff were great it\xe2\x80\x99s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline downI enjoyed my flightThe boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professionalThe food selection was good and I enjoyed the qualityThe \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacyBut the times for their flights suited me so I decided to give them another goThe flight left on time (just about), the cabin was clean and the staff friendlyThere was even complimentary tea/coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economyThe flight was pleasant enough and I can\'t think of any negatives to write aboutThe flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet.Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next levelOnce on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA styleThe seat was quite comfortableIt was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite goodThe IFE is excellent, responsive and good qualityThere is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of gamesWIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think \xc2\xa317.99 for full flight is bad valueCabin crew were very goodFriendly and efficientLanding and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at allOverall a very solid experience in economySignificantly better than it used to be.\xc2\xa0Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn\'t too badClub passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA\'s club passengers only at this time ofLovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasantSeated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partnerThere is no better way to fly when you are a coupleFlying BA when the crew is good is amazingService was impecable on this flightJust the right mix of humor, service and attentionI am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be betterOn time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at HeathrowWe had a lovely shower at the \'spa\', what a fabulous facilityWho ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess!

Travel with ConfidenceLuckily it shows up quickly, and I rebookWhen I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issuesStaff was attentive though and tried their best.This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business ClassAlso, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg roomFood, service and entertainment options were goodClearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy.Amazing flight and comfortableNew aircraftStaff very friendly and professionalThe food was great, beyond expectation.Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmareI would like to thank you for the great serviceI had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazingThey took great care of me and made sure I was doing well throughout the whole flight.The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for meThe staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughoutThe messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellentThe food was first class, nothing was too much for the staffBritish Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proudCheck in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was cleanWhen boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or lessOnce airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain keptOverall a very pleasant tripWe will be flying again with British AirwaysI expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good resultsExcellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seatGood staff as everThe service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this sizeThe seat was comfortable for economy and because the A380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of spaceThe food was good for airplane foodBoarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crewShout out to the help desk at Heathrow, we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was great, she had a tough crowdto deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay, food to eat and a flight home the next day.My flight to Paris was no exceptionThe short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope forA very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good foodCrew was wonderful New seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortableEntertainment greatGenerally a positive experience.Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroomin 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15Anyway I thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once.New Club Suites are amazing, the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow I have ever usedFood was ok as I have had better on BA in the past and I can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is OKThe cabin crew were brilliant but I was surprised that after dinner the crew didn\xe2\x80\x99t once come round with beverages or even bottled waterBA really have a great hard product here and I would suspect the soft product will improve once Covid restrictions become less of an issueWell done BA.Cabin crew for BA actually really friendly.Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very oftenTook off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flightI recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great againFirst, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are aComfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very privateNice friendly FA\'s (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner servedThank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showingTook off and landed on timeSmooth flightthe lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flightBoarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagneDrinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumblerBreakfast was slightly more edible than dinnerCabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests forApart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of scheduleAll in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quicklyThe flight itself was fine, on timeBut today I got another surpriseSeats comfortableOn return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand newGood quality of sleep on both legs, which was goodCheck in at LHR was flawless and without incidentI will say, the cheese and port were niceI will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I\xe2\x80\x99m happy in Club and would never do First again.Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on BA for first timeBy some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flightI had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal andOur experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good experienceUnbelievableThe aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so smallAlso, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost savingBoarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on scheduleThere are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those,Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparisoncoat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolleyOutstanding! From the warm, smiling welcome on board, this flight was excellentThe in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professionalFood and wine all very good indeedThe Premium Economy product on BA is also very goodComfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent reclineFR superior to any other airline on other Atlantic routes.The attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity.Check in at IAD was quick and easyLounge in Washington was a BA lounge and very goodSound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flightFlight on time and boarded promptlyThere was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted itWe slept wellOn time arrival and quickly made it to T5 arrivals lounge which was excellent.BA got everything rightAllowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the USLounge clean, staff proactive and food served quicklyGood range of drinksAircraft ready, boarding quick and well organisedThe cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good serviceThe food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellentAlthough it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintainedOverall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs WellThis past November/December I flew Washington-London return and, on the strength of that trip (my first in two years), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned toThe cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabincrews remain the best in the businessIt\'s good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and I\'m looking forward to future trips on BA.I had the best experience I have ever had with an airlineThe person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help usI had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airlineHowever, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATLThe aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacityService was excellent, staff were friendly and efficientThe LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again.Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hoursafter take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flightThe Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or twoThe large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsiveWaking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toiletsPerformance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of scheduleOverall, a good flight.The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possibleIn the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke toIn November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New YorkThe lounge was busy, but no complaintsI used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted meI went to "Club check-in" and the lady was incredibly kind to meI just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at faultShe weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfullyDiversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it The staff was very kind and friendly as wellWhat a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking aroundOrdered a frittata as was so hungryLooking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentiveLuckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport. I normally find BA cabin crew very niceLounge staff were very nice in both directionsFor the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on timeAfter two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight toThese seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupiedCPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigrationIt was good to be back!Very nice return flight with BATo add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don\xe2\x80\x99t jump out and thenThe A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lightingRow 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortableOnce again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is neededLovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for foodGreat WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classesDomestic T5 arrivals is a breeze.Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidaysLounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time)Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lightingAlthough seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroomin row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch)The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertasteAfternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tastyI am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trustNevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawbackFirst of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken The crew were nice so sorry I missed that.BA\xe2\x80\x99s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamlessThe bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zonesThe cabin crew were a credit to the airline \xe2\x80\x93 smartly dressed, friendly and keen to pleaseThe food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landingObviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed.Excellent check in and securityLounge was goodFood and drink choices very goodCabin service top banana!!

Crew really professional and happy it seemedWe did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks serviceBack to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respectAll I can say is good luck.Another BA shuttle flight and a good oneFantastic flying weather and I would say a 40% load factorGood professional crewAnd getting to the A gates at T5 makes for an easy exitStill a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery.Check in was okFlight left 20 minutes late but made up time en routeStaff were friendly and as responsive as they could beThe Check in Manager, Goncalo Ribeiro, came to our rescueHe was at the Gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better serviceHe was a very professional ambassador for BA!Outstanding and wonderful to have BA backThe welcome on board was warm and sincereFlight attendants helpful, friendly and professionalGreat updates from the flight deckSuper lunch and good choice of winesBA at its bestHopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new CEO with the departure of Alex Cruz.Good flight but boarding was chaos, was gifted with the beautiful A10 gate at LHR T5(, so we were bussed to the plane (first time I\'ve used a bus gateUsual BA economy trip, pleasant crewComplimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable pricesOther than that BA still offers a good product that can be good value or over pricedThis time it was good value.Check in was easy, security quick, lounge fineLounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which was great)Flight was fine, my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps I agreeDrinks were fine and proactively servedOn arrival efficient PCR testing where it was needed and fast turnaroundI\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companionI have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a reviewThe flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delightOn both inward and outward journeys, I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crewI was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabinMy particular thanks must go to Amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to British AirwaysI cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, Thank you so so much.The plane was clean and air quality very goodTiming was perfectHowever, on my way to London from Toronto, my experience was a good oneThe service was excellentThe cabin staff were attentive and efficientThe food and drinks were very goodThe seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really niceOverall a very enjoyable flight.I\xe2\x80\x99ve been such a good customer and feel I deserve better.However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while theAspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drinkDrinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows, but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yoreDisembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quicklyThe crew at Denver airport is top notch! So impressed with their customer serviceThey were very patient and courteousThank you all for being amazing.Other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touchBA is still by far the best operator from Ulster to England.The flight down from London I was in business class I asked for the mini bottle of champagne that I always treat myself to the cabin crew member said IBoarding by groups efficient and flight almost fullGood drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunchArrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at LCA.Very pleasant flight to Lisbon!

My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either -I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I\'m sure but I hopethis is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasantwas going to my Mother\'s funeral with the flowers she was apologetic (she had no idea why I was bringing in flowers) but the crew were very nice to meStarting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I wantThe crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for thisShe is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, as my results didn\xe2\x80\x99tHowever, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arriveI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to helpHowever, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards meThe nicest lady I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed methroughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional supportShe was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can\xe2\x80\x99t thank her enoughShe also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly didHe was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered toTo conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly doI don\xe2\x80\x99t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring andproviding jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like aHowever, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surpriseGalleries South lounge open, they have an app system, it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quicklyFlight on time and well presented A321Staff worked hard, nice drinks run, the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these timesOverall, happy with product and would use again.Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlinesI had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened toThey have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible ratherOverall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for thegreat customer service I received.I am extremely pleased with British Airways as they refunded my tickets Munich-London City-Munich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner: the difference between British Airways andWell Done and Best Wishes to all at British Airways.Boarding and checkin formalities are very niceCheck in help desk was very helpful and supportiveI have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in ClubEurope, which turned out to be a perfect decisionThe stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chattyAlthough the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me down eitherEfficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona)The aircraft was very fresh and cleanSeats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power portsThe on board service is different than before Corona times but it\xe2\x80\x99s still very goodTasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousseThe choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas FeuillatteAll in all a perfect flight experience with British AirwaysEverything I expected from this flight was fulfilledAt least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean.I was pleasantly surprisedPlane was on time and spotlessly cleanLovely deplaning with special Covid social distancing system working well.A month later, I tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow I was successfulIt\'s how you deal with problems that mark out good customer serviceA short hop from London to Edinburgh in November 2019 - efficient, clean and punctualThe airport experience was straightforward and I think flying from City you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortableI got my luggage quickly at the other end and I appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from.I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets shouldI was able to change my flight at no cost, which is greatMy wife and I used Avios and the BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holidayI was also excited to fly on an A350 for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectationsThe aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting, very comfortable spacious seats and large high-resolution IFE screensI like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection availableWe both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crewMy wife and I used Avios and my BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown wasThe check-in and security were very efficient and the lounge (not belonging to BA) was clean but had a more limited range of food than I would have expectedBoarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professionalI am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of BA\'s new A350\'s and this brought home to me that the 747 business classThe seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality IFE screen was behind the timesBritish Airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience, starting from check in and ending on the deplaningVery friendly, smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the lovely captain, who gave all the information about delay, missed slot and new departure timeWhat is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and hassuch good air filters that we are safe hereThe boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentiallyI didn\'t try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments freeUSA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 callsStaff at the call centre efficient and helpfulOn the plane the staff were excellent - as usualFood was good - verging on very goodBreakfast a little small but tastyI even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleepThankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my needThe British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundableHopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us.I wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flightThe stewards dealt with this situation with tact, absolute professionalism and great courtesyThey are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and I wish to thank our crew in particularWhat a way to treat their customersBA has really upped their game nowFood is tasty, and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungryThis could be improved but I appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not BA\'s partner Overall, BA has really improved the game, andthe friendly and professional crews are the best in the worldGreat airline indeed! Staff were friendly and helpful! The aircraft was very cleanThe crews are diverseWill definitely fly again.The check in process was quick, efficient and friendlyThe entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually workedGood service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier thoughVery happy with the service.Fortunately, the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight, with great service and positive, friendly attitudeI actually praised them and told them that my faith in BA had been restored!There are time when British Airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriersFrom the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at LHR, the crew were outstandingFriendly, attentive and professionalThe dinner was excellentExcellent choices on the menu, accompanied by some decent winesVery thoughtfulSeat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanketIFE goodThe B747-400 is showing its age but it\xe2\x80\x99s still a wonderful, iconic aircraft to fly on and I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to prefer it over the B777.The brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the CX lounge at Heathrow T3To cram 14 first-class seats onto a 777 is quite an achievementConversely, the flight attendants were excellent in both directionsMy husband and I traveled togetherCome prepared!My plane from Mexico City to London was smoothEntertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although I chose a window seat and was never informed it wasn\'t actually the window, but a wall!

It felt as if we were living in the Truman Show at one point but in the nicestGet yourselves down to good ole Austin now that BA fly there directFantastic.But, it was the most enjoyable flight we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken for a long timeIt was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough for you, and always with a smileWe arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experienceOnce airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quiteA big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of \xc2\xa34.99 forSo, not too bad, all in all.Smooth flight, departure/arrival on timeBoarding was quick, the seat was okThe food was good, and the wine (french, Bourgogne) also surprisingly goodFlight attendant was professional, polite and attentive to detailAll in all, a great flight.Boarding was however smoothOn board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I\'m 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seatIn flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to waitAll in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel bookingThe only plus was the Embraer E190 jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seatOther than that BA now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airlineFortunately, arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of Kefalonia airport 30 minutes laterThen the email at 6.00pm saying I must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelledFirst class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poorEvening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near AbujaFull credit to the crew - cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etcSeats are just about OK goingCheck-in at Belfast City was fast and trouble free and security was completed with-in just a few minutes with no queues to mentionThe inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete mannerFood was plentiful and tasty, entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fineNo complaints at all about the flight and would recommend British Airways.Two recent flights on BA, and very happy with themGood crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hootAgain good crewAt boarding was told our World Traveller plus seats had been upgraded to Club World, a very pleasant surpriseIf was on 777 which had not been refurbished, extra space was very good, staff were very efficient and pleasantSo thank you BA for the experience.A very good flightThe food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of Etihad\xe2\x80\x98s disastrous changes in food service)The children\xe2\x80\x99s meals were excellentThe entertainment system was great with a good selectionIt makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with childrenThe cabin crew were goodGood value flight, especially as the only other carrier to Abu Dhabi is Etihad.I have had better meals in economy class in other airlinesThe seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course)On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all theReasonable price and speed.The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines AdvantageTheir customer service was outstandingThe fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each otherI had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from Chennai to London by British airwaysI am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey reallyreally smoothThank you so muchInside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first personOver all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with BA and Heathrow airport#happyautism# Thank youI have just returned to KL from an extended visit in UK seeing family and friendsI was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name I didn\'t quite catchThe point I wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flightShe was exceptionalIt really made the journey one of the best on board experiences I have had.The Concorde room in Heathrow Terminal 5 was amazing, the dinner experience was great and the food was deliciousOn the plane, the crew was very friendly and niceDinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food was okayBed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable, perhaps the best I have hadOverall, the journey was great.I have often flown British Airways and have considered them a good airlineIf you have no problems this is a good airlineGood morningRegardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed toThey were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra costCustomer service was outstandingSo compassionate and helpfulI am beyond grateful for their helpThey on the other hand actually fly and on timeI am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BAAt least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjusterThe customer service is increasingly low cost in feel.Inflight crew were very helpful, polite and caringThough you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines, it was quite pleasantFood was excellentBusiness Class cabin comfortableTo our great surprise British Airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family (7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years) from Terminal 5Flight to Pisa on time, good crew, good on board catering, arrived 15 minutes before the time.A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCEThe crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new)The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg roomAn overall very good experience on board this flight.Excellent customer serviceThe aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on timeTowards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caringSo despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for meThe return journey went without a hitch and BA\'s check in at Orlando was quick and easy.The seat is more comfortable than other airlines A320It has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leatherNo problems at the airport in Vienna, it was easy to find the British Airways check in deskThe flight was on timeThe cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasantI also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread, and it was very deliciousAfter all I enjoyed the flight with British Airways.I agree totally with the comments made in Michael Croft\'s review todayBritish Airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines, easily beaten by EasyjetWe booked our tickets (family of 7) two months before the flight with British Airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service (so we thought)It was quick and worked well, our bag was 25 kg, maximum is 23 kg, so we had to take 2 kg outIt was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30mThe seats were comfortable, leather and had headrestsThe food was good and wasn\'t too expensiveWhile coming into Bulgaria, the views were niceThe landing was pretty good, despite the bumpThe verdict is that British Airways are pretty good, despite the delay.Nice to Kuwait via LondonMy wife and I flew back from Argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess (Amelia) who gave great service to everyone with herfriendly professional mannerOn finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday cardThe aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortableThe seat especially the headrest is quite comfortableI must state staff on plane very good.Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flightdire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just OKThe flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time (allowing for the rerouting around Pakistani airspace).When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to theOn my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack! I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovelyThank you so much!Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressiveVery impressive for a domestic business class loungeI would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in frontThese seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better supportNeedless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciatedIt was also rather tasty and tasted quite freshThe crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these daysBut since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes senseI think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African AirwaysFor the price paid, I\'d be happy to fly them again.Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabinThe cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasantThe entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devicesI suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertainingWe sat in a 2, which was more bearableI remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haulService was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edibleThe extra comfort compared to Economy Class is unparalleledThe seat is way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and very friendlythen it would be perfectThe plane from London to Toronto was run by Air Belgium The service from checkin until we received our cases here in Israel was excellentThe cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendlyThe food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was servedSoft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flightThe planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy classInflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flightsThe captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteousContinental breakfast in business was OK for this short flightThe team was very friendlyThe service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad andIt must be said the meal was an improvement since last yearDecent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by coffee or teaThe look on other people\xe2\x80\x99s faces was good enough for me to know don\xe2\x80\x99t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted witha drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was goodIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite unbelievable.Outbound Galleries North fine and good breakfastFlight was fineStaff on both flights fineReturn aircraft quite new and well presented.Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature canwould get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners trayThe positives the IFE has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights I haveI would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service I received from the BA cabin crew members during my flight BA0011 from London Heathrow to Singapore on 25 JuneThe cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs, enabling them to relax & enjoy their flightI feel very proud that British Airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard, it really is a privilege to fly British Airways.Fortunately, this was my last ever trip on BA.I had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for meThey had gave me a free bottle of water, kept asking if I was okay, put their arm around me, made me feel so much betterThe flight was super smooth and overall an amazing serviceThanks again BA and I will be flying again with you soon!A generous Dirham 20 voucher (\xc2\xa33,8) received from BA, which was enough for a bottle of water, or a coffee.A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones providedThe IFE system was easy to useI asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaintsNewspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenityIt was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seatingThe pilot introduced them as gorgeousThe flight landed on timeOverall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New YorkThe staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience, refreshing to see these daysThe quality of food and drinks was wonderfulWe would definitely fly again with BA, and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinationsThat was fine I resolved to reading my bookShe came back with a bottle of Champagne, a pair of Pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! Tosay I was overwhelmed was an understatement! All I can say is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for my Birthday and youcertainly made it something special!Boarded very quickly and on time, Seating area smart, appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn upService very good, food was the best I have had from BA, new crockery added to the good feel and appearance, long overdueDuvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route, the Pillow is fabulous, gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, I hope this is a turning point for British AirwaysThank you I am looking forward to my Seychelles flight in October and my Rio flight in December, keep it coming.PerfectThe Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environmentThe flight took off and landed on timeThe cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experienceArrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficientAll in all a very enjoyable trip.Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortableExpensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enoughPleasant FA\'s so all in all decent flightsThe 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual MS for sale products.I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by \xc2\xa3328 and seats were only booked on theToilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidyThe IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and musicGround crew was pretty niceCrew were okayTiming was good and air quality felt ok as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a headache.Crew was fine, entertainment system on the London to New York leg was very niceCheck-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morningBoarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economyThe flight product was just OK in my viewI remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smileHowever, I arrived on time and promptly got my bagThe 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds andI wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while I was terribly sickForever grateful.and comfortable plenty of storage the IFE was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness!A truly first class experience from check in to landingCheck in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellentThe flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to noneThe cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seatsThroughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearingNew soft product is very good and food definitely much improved.My husband and I have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in AmericaWe have always been very satisfied with the serviceAdvice was sought via radio, I was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etcMany thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that I must have disturbed.Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overheadFree newspapers were available in the jet wayPassengers were warmly greetedThe cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstandingAll in all a couple of very good flights.Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flightEverything went smoothly and service was goodBoarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabinHowever the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellentWe had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left downThe service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendlyThere was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of winesBreakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and breadThere could be no complaints in respect of cateringThe A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crewVery nice experienceFrom the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantasticCrew on the flight was outstanding and very attentiveFood was good, not great, but very goodSeats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review)Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home runAA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good jobCPT is definitely getting its act together: BA\'s Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for onceThe upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club WorldThe new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxuriousOn the whole, I think it works and having the \'triple bread\' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than servedBreakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoffApart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of scheduleA good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.Helpful and courteous cabin crewHowever, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two backThe lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flightOverall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket deliveryThe only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleepI normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprisedThe outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and makeHowever, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with theMy wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fineOnce again we landed on time, which was a good thingThe cabin crew on flight BA035 London to Chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clientsKeep up the good service and, thanks!Check in was fairly quickThe lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suitThe food and drink offering was very goodTasty and variedOn board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opiniondrinks selection is betterWhat was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver memberI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect this, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyersOverall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using aviosBeing silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus.Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first timeWas very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the WindowSeat itself was the standard one, comfortableThe inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journeyIf both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher.London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new \'soft\' productthe impression of the positive changes in the on-board serviceThe young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained aboutFor once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decentBedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillowThe goodies bag is much better and worth taking homeOverall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th MayDespite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for thisThey were friendly, polite and couldn\'t do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section II do hope that this information is passed on.Being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bagsI would be happy to pay for their Premium seatsAn excellent flight on BAI travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competitionSeats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstandingProfessional, smiling, friendlyThey embodied BA at their very best.The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabinNothing short of amazingI was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crewAbsolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked aboutDemeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approachA fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assistThis route still has complimentary refreshments in economy, including wine \xe2\x80\x93 a great bonus and pleasant surpriseCabin service was pleasant and professionalA really excellent flight.The only reason that I\xe2\x80\x99ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were goodI spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversaryIt was supposed to be our trip of a lifetimethe app so I was not disappointedAround 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne,Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my dayThanks to the crew.Thank you to James, a Club World flight attendant on BA 0103 April 15, 2019His service was impeccable, attentive and delightfulI thoroughly enjoyed the flight.The staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous tripReally they could not have been more helpful and I would recommend them.Perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfastHad a starter and then settled down and slept better than expectedOn-time arrival and AA Arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers.I\xe2\x80\x99ve no problem with that, I like travelling safelyI found the crew very friendly and even humorous! Whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (I was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendlycomments which almost always lead to muffled laughs! One air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter!British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flightI booked online and found that process very easyThe check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herselfWithin the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staffThe flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effortOne curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle)Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum I hope BA will improve their actCheck in at T3 was fine, lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the caseFlight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fineSkilled landing in Gibraltar- a good flightService OKDespite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked afterWithout exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professionalThey really seemed to be enjoying their workCommendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonicWell done BADespite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internallyThe check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informativeThe flight arrived reasonably promptly.Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags inDeparture was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated wellThe staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoyHardworking crew.Had a fantastic flight in the new BA First cabin on the Boeing 787On both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the serviceThe food was of high end restaurant standard, the seat comfortable.Website advertises \xe2\x80\x98Premium Levels of Service\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.\xe2\x80\x99 The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasonsThe music that accompanies the advert is called \xe2\x80\x98Salvation\xe2\x80\x99 and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking itMassive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a CafeteriaThe agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problemI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it\xe2\x80\x99s great to see BA treat their customers with care.though the service was OK not as personal but alrightWhere they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generousI will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class.Long time since I flew Club Europe but it was an amazing experienceThe welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and foodStephen, one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience I have had in a longWell done to the crew on that flight!ThanksCheck in agent very helpful in searching out seat optionsVery smooth processAll was redeemed once on boardThe crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best British Airways tradition - friendly, helpful and attentiveWines better than many airlinesThe aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747-400IFE selection good.The First Class zone at Heathrow T5 and the Concorde Lounge are very goodService on board was excellent in both directionsI enjoyed the flights in both directions, mainly because of the serviceHave flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and serviceCan\'t fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brandThey are professional, friendly and courteousCattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customersThe only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaintIt will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughoutA very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengersEntertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyoneThanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently wehardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service.One of the best European airlines to travel with for short haul flightsThe online website is very clear and easy to useCheck-in procedure was smoothBoarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridgeBritish Airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good qualityAs a frequent traveler, I\'ve been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seatsThis airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver membersThe lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshmentsThe bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks availableI\'m very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend British AirwaysKeep it up guys.Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebrationTickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium EconomyIt\'s been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flightsFrom the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpfulOn the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get itThe seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I\'m 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough tooThe entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV toBoth flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going onOverall a very pleasant flight, thanks BAThe new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) boozeOn the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wineOn the way back - a ploughman\'s lunch, it was okay-ishI know I could do a lot better than the current board at BAOh, what a surprise and that\'s the clear objective of the directorsSo what would I do with Club Europe? I\'d make it the best in EuropeThere would be a nice centre tableNice cutlery and glass/china ware"Build value guys" and the profits will followI will give credit where credit is dueVery nice chapWe took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fineFAs in both directions were very good.Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the priceThe cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were goodThe reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew wereThe crew on this flight were amazing, nothing was too much troubleThank you to all involved on that flight.On the bright said, I did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices.Interestingly i was able to find & book another one through Skyscanner again with BA at the day of my initial flight with \xc2\xa3100 more, of courseSince the aircraft was half full, I was looking for a great flightWe left on time, and that was the only positive pointI told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menuBreakfast was served which was OKGood was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improvedAt Miami airport on October 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent, so professional, nice and helpful to the every last detailNow on February 2019 calling British Airways to redeem my Avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient, knowledgeable and nice agentYou are doing great with such fantastic employees.The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats wereI was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcomingAll in all the service was good and worth the priceLounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowdedBoarding was fine, small delay, well organisedPre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previousMain meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked itOn time arrival, a good flightCabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mileI thought this was a good flight.Flew BA new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set upWell lit cabin, improved seating comfort, better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent foodCabin crew worked hard and were pleasantIt was amazingThe crew were very friendlyThe food was amazing and the seats were comfortableT was overall an amazing flight and I enjoyed it thoroughly.There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flightCabin crew worked well and gave splendid serviceIn the beginning everything went normal and smoothFlying premium economy on British Airways from New Orleans to London was an absolute pleasureThe nine hour flight was an amazing experience, with great legroom, reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noiseDefinitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again.I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at NaritaWe boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boardedThe food and wines were really goodI had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western optionsThere was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screenWe had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crewMy wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucherWe were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was greatWe boarded on time and the cabin did not disappointWe had very grand seats with lovely surroundingsThe cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wantedThe food and alcoholic drinks were greatI went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee puddingMy wife and I both said afterwards that it didn\'t feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortablyUpon arrival I was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectfulHe calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay ,as I was very very stressed thinking I was going to miss my flightI just want to thank him again as he made my experience with British Airways like no other and I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful.Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a SundayGreat overall experience.Flown with British Airways on numerous occasions with no issuesI kindly accepted to take the next flightQuick and easy flight to ParisEverything went well and the cabin was very cleanMain was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selectionBreakfast was okArrivals lounge was goodChatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire durationThe cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortableI\'ve always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travelI have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economyThen today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheapNot only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!)Outstanding.Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on timeThe seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors\' premium cabinThe IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one\'s own noise cancelling headphones are usedThe drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvementThe fish option for the main course was some of the best food I\'ve had in the airCabin crew were generally good and the CSM was particularly visible during the flightBreakfast was improved with the option to pre-select itemsFast track security was fast and got to lounge quicklyLounge was ok, food a little better and staff seemed more attentiveWe were able to use the spa which was niceShowers were fine with no queuesFlight left on timeMy first experience of the new Club World catering which seemed to go well Slept for 5 hours, lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777\xe2\x80\x99sCrew on this sector were good and the FA serving our area was experienced and it showedA good flightExcellent short flight from Heathrow to Dublin in Club EuropeCabin Crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellentThe Club Europe catering was excellent, I had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free breadThis was the best inflight meal I\'ve had on a short haul flightBut the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and I enjoyed the flightThe seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft freshDuring the second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliersA hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheeseQuality red and white wine was servedThe inflight movie selection was OKBoarding was fairly quick, the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags storedI was lucky that no one was sitting next me, so I had some more room Within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessertThe movie selection was OKThe PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge differencevalidatedReally we had a great experience with British AirwaysWe enjoyed very much flying with British AirwaysLovely staff and great service.The saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew.Nice headrestThe Muslim meal (chicken tikka masala with naan) was restaurant qualityThe gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom\'sThe low sodium meal - herb roasted chicken, tomato rice, petite broccoli, diced red pepper and carrots was deliciousThe IFE was very goodBright and clear LED screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages.We were fortunate to get exit row seats in advanceThey were spacious with plenty of legroomSo impressed by the lady that checked us inShe was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minuteWith grateful hearts we were checking in our bagsWhen she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft! How awesome is that! Thank you British Airways and their helpful staff.That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn\'t fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind beforeThis means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you\'re in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigrationIn Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time)787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabinSeat pitch is also decentThese are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortableYou do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpasteThe seat back screen is large and easy to useThis gives it a sort of cosy feelThat helped me stretch out for sureAll in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggageNow they have finally relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cardsAlthough I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the foodI was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.gHaving been grumpy about several aspects of BA\'s service in the past, I will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements.The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitoryThe staff at the airport were very friendly and helpfulThe aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and cleanThe seat was comfortable and had a good wing viewThe aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpfulThe flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some trafficOverall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flightmade the flight in 11F a little more bearableI normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensiveBooked a flight through Expedia for June 21019 from Denver to Paris via London on the promise that I could upgrade using AviosThe only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the nightWas very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many yearsCrews were friendly and helpfulIt started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminalThe North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much betterMuch has been said about the seat being "an up market business class" - and this is trueThe food is also business class qualityOutstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesanMy wife had the soup which she said was niceThe glassware and chinaware was okayQuality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu coversI\'m a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspectiveFrom a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ishThe FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.Fantastic first class serviceThe Moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent Runway viewsThe new First seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older productThe 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphonesThe dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal I\'ve hadThe crew were very attentive and friendly with itA fantastic experience, and I\'ll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin.Morning flight from GLA to LHR was okI really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! We left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to JFKOn the JFK flight the service was fantasticThe meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flightWe left and arrived on timeThe seat and legroom was fineMy mothers IFE didn\'t work and she was moved seat, which she appreciatedThe cabin crew were very friendly.Breakfast was pretty goodArrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight.However, during my trip from London to Mexico City on 2 Dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with Muslim needs on foodThey are polite and talk to me with big smilesSo, when I returned back to Malaysia and transit in London from Mexico City on 5 Dec 2018, I wished I will be able to meet them againHope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip.\r\nI would like to compliment British Airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight, service from the crew and the food servedBefore landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering companyOverall a very enjoyable flight from London Gatwick to Tampa.We have been loyal customers with British Airways since I was a little girlBoarding by group number seemed to work well at Gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take offThe crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a teamBA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had on a long haul flightAll in all a very enjoyable flight.Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfastOther airlines do this better.I had a great Customer service treatment at the check in at Phoenix by the young lady who checked me inShe was very professional and handled my check in process excellentlyMy entire trip was great and I really was treated very well also on my final leg to Accra by the BA staff in London as wellJust want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for usThe Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourseThe first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the \'suites\' also had more room and extra storage spaceThe dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacyThe fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonusCabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professionalFood was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properlyThe wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tastingSleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little highOverall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was whatThe 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing okThe crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my babyThe only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to HeathrowThe flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seatThe flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured I was comfortable throughout the flightSuperb Customer Service.Had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in businessDrinks served with a smile and the food alsoThe best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding.I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day.I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it toArrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an easeOn the aircraft, there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7F A funny safety video played and the flight was smoothThe plane landed half an hour late, but it was the best landing I have ever experienced.However I did have seat 2J so it was right up frontBoth my flights were great, on time and the food was good on the flight to London, and a nice bottle of champagne as wellMy long haul flight was also good, aircraft was 20yrs old but clean, cabin crew were very nice, friendly and efficient, my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic, the onlysome good classic rock music that people have actually heard of, apart from that, absolutely great, well recommended.While it is still fresh in my mind, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to commend the hard working crew of my BA flight from St.Petersburg to London Heathrow on 23rd October 2018The check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a queryBoarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly mannerThe cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor tooThe cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly earlyThe captain was informativeDisembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere wayThis flight has restored my faith in BAWell done to the superb crew!I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flightGood improvementThree choices of main and food was good qualityGood BA listened to feedbackThe ground staff were very friendly and the plane was cleanFinally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable.On the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly, so is the baggage allowance, plane although not new was cleanThe plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for usConcorde Room not crowded and no wait for showersLHR-PHL on aged 747 but still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good shape thoughExcellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professionalBeautifully prepared and presented lamb shank, good wines as always - nice to see a good British bubbly includedBedding finally a decent pillow, a very good one indeedBA offers you the most limited offer.The cabin service was as good as expectedWe were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen againReluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drinkThe second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edibleonce proud airlinefor these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happyAs i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA nowThe flight Calgary to London (stopover) was okThe vacation itself was greatThe food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flightsThe airport staff was very helpful, the crew was also very nice and the food was deliciousI had the old personal entertainment system but it works very wellOverall it was one of the best flights I had.It was a wonderful flight I was lucky having a 2-seats-row for my own on the upperdeck, but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfectThe crew was very friendly and the food was the best I\'ve had on an airplaneBest seats on the plane: 83A or 83K.British Airways was always my first priorityThis, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only justThe breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OKThe lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather niceThe Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviationA very nice bloke, who landed the plane superblyWe had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlierA nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation ChickenFAs on both flights were greatThere has been a massive improvement here on the catering sideBA really should look at the competition in the Far East who offer excellent regionalized business classOn the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabinIFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obligingExcellent boarding procedure as it was a full flightAgain, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabinOverall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who\'d have been better suited to RyanairIt was a connecting flight, so I should not complainBritish Airways is my favorite airlineThe staff was professionalFood was above expectationFlight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on timeFlight attendants friendly and welcomingSeat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tightWas prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menuConnection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoonBoarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painlessHappy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageableThe selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen beforeThe real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their serviceThey were generous with drinks and very efficient and quickAll in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector.Staff very cheerfulThe cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spaciousThe sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfyIt is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contentsThe Champagne that BA offer in first is superbI enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tastedChoice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinkerFood was very tasty and well presentedIt was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals tooThe thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crewFrom the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulousAttentive with out being over-bearingWitty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every needThey were superbThis was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out firstI love flying in 767s, the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve thisAside from this the flight was really very good indeedBA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently goodBA cabin crew in Business class are a real assetThis was one of BA\'s more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphereThe flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experienceFood was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinksGroup boarding was handled efficientlyDespite the congestion and chaos, the food and drink service was handled efficiently, although the food was no better than the old World Traveller offeringThis promises fast track, choice of seats at booking, priority boarding and lounge accessPremium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabinPolite, efficient, welcoming and nothing was any bother for herService with a smile from start to finish People in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great jobAlso meals and drink selection very goodAlthough leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done BA and looking forward to return journey.The flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway.The flight was full (with kids) and the crew did everything to make the journey smoothBusiness Class seating in 787/9 very conducive for family travelling, allows for interactionService on both flights was flawless, very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the mealsFood presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantasticOutstanding crew on BA 603 and BA 99 - on our outgoing flights from Toronto on August 16 similar great serviceBA gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experienceTheir seating arrangement in Club World is perfect when travelling with familyCheck-In at Dulles Airport was smoothThe seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was goodAll in all an ok meal, nothing to complain aboutConnecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere! Security went fastThere is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free WIFIWe boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowdsHowever I thought the pricing was ok.I always like travelling on a BA A380Seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planesThankfully BA airline staff are always the best.Really good crew on both legs of the journeyGot to board first and let crew know about the fact I was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonusLoved the fact that they asked if I was OK on board too.Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around,all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankfulThe flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpitThe seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamasThe seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage spaceYou get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of roomI had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very goodThe meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went andThe bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching outThere were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very wellI opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of itThe inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose fromThe system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound qualityThe crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn\xe2\x80\x99t do, the crew went out of their way to make one forme which was very niceThey really made this already special experience even more specialIf you want to treat yourself to BA First, I would thoroughly recommend it.Nice plane, nice seats, low quality service on the planeI expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airlineFinally, BA has moved back into it\xe2\x80\x99s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture(apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good serviceAn upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surpriseExcellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourselfEfficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crewThe Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow \xe2\x80\x93 more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to thePlenty of wine and drinks along with T&CAll that said, I felt that BA is regaining it\xe2\x80\x99s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performanceLong may this improvement last!San Francisco to London Heathrow on the lower deck of the A380 - a very quiet smooth flightWelcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FAOK meal - beef - with decent wines to accompanyVery extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted itReally very good FA\'s - made you feel welcomeIf Virgin Atlantic fly the same route I will always choose their Upper Class as everyone has aisle access and you don\'t have to pay to pre-reserve your seat.BA managed everything in a very professional mannerThe cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a videoDuring this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impressionI had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb.That being said, this is better than any low-cost carrier.Delivering outstanding customer service onboardBritish Airways may not have the cleanest, newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight  since I have flown with them.This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not badBut we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn\'t secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - andvery welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crewLikewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etcAll very courteous and professionalAfter such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there wasI\'ve had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dryWe travelled on the first Saturday of the school holidays and whilst Gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to badWe expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seatsWe are used the BA\'s Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortableService from the cabin crew was goodIt is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glassThe meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the main course, which was tasty and not dried outVery happy with the service.Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpfulNorwegian offers free wifi so I could check my phone on the planeThe seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, I would have had enough space to feel very comfortableHowever, Lufthansa on the A380 (also Y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me)The seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to listen to some BBC concerts)The crew didn\'t impress me but was very friendly and helpfulThe food was extraordinarily good (the chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert) I had a good experience with BA and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average)Premium economy is a good value for money, especially on a 15 hrs flight.Pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main mealOK choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of Prosecco when boardedFortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle accessAnd we could look at each other and not at a total strangerFA\'s great welcoming and gave good serviceSo, although we had quite a pleasant flight to Seattle with BA in Club, if Virgin Atlantic fly the same route we will choose their Upper Class over Clubworld -Boarding was pretty much seamlessThe cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was niceThe legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flightGood recline aswellFlights were on timeSo overall, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.A few problems at Heathrow with the wrong gate being shown (BA ground staff didn\'t seem to care this was an issue) but the flights were excellent, comfortable and onI really don\'t mind paying for the food and drink inflight, especially as you can pay using AviosMurcia airport also a joySmall, efficient and friendlyVery impressed.After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so laterI must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very goodThe crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and wateredThis is the full extent of my praise thoughI have never heard anything like itYou get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention The flight then was pretty much okay, the food was delicious, had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks, the flight staff was kind and helpfulIf it wasn\'t for Avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying BA if you collect them and use Executive Club for award tickets within Europe I wouldCheck in efficient and friendly and helpful staffStaff very welcoming in lounge and on board flightI was fortunate to travel Hong Kong to London return in Premium Economy recentlyBeing able to check-in at the downtown Hong Kong Airport Express station is a real bonus as is using the good Qantas Lounge at Hong KongI found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World StatusBA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programsI also particularly welcomed the excellent service from \'Goswami\' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at HeathrowAll-in -all made for an enjoyable experience, a rarity these days.Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at FaroOverall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.Priority disembarkation and baggage at Gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly.Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club loungeThe lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcomingThe lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jamAs always the drinks offering in BA lounges was greatThe new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcomeOverall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.However, The crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious tooThe flight from LHR to Chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generousTheir business class in Europe is economy class with a free seat next to you.I was nicely impressedThe crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweetI was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinksSeats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for BA to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger\'s legs to get out fromOtherwise they were good flights with, slightly odd choices, but decent foodSeat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most European carriersCrew were friendly and the flight on time.Better service with Ryanair, I hate to say it.I give full marks to BA on this occasion in most areas of serviceThe check-in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willinglyHe was professional and pleasant and very efficient tooThe flight was on an A320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented tooThe cabin crew were welcoming and orderlyAlthough there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressedI bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortableOverall a very good experience with BA.Wonderful service on the flight from Edinburgh-Florence on 7 July 18Mainline British Airways could learn lots from BA CityFlyer and their franchise partner in S Africa (Com Air).First the good pointCabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on BA169 London to Shanghai on 22 JuneThe inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the 90s, but the selection of movies was alrightextra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg roomI\'m quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handlingsuch a blessingShe calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftlyI was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I didThe service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flightI thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in theThe food was ok, I\'ve had worse, I\'ve had betterBut I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of filmsMy connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicelyAll in all I\'m glad I flew BA for this trip.The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charmThe food was more than adequateThe in-flight entertainment was adequate toosmaller cabin matters, then it is worth itThey more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking.When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with British Airways staffThe guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long wayOf course the 787 is a great aircraftBritish Airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to Gibraltar was faultlessOn time (early arrival in fact), smiling friendly crew, excellent hot meal and plentiful drinksGatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats okFine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffedThank goodness for washing machinesWe can not fault the new \'Club World\' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! The food was first class, the presentation very attractive,the quality very high - haven\'t had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarketIt\'s worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerfulReally liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted toYou now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than theThe pillow is larger and tons better than beforeCan\'t believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in Seattle and once home againReturn flight on A380 left on time, 100% better service, meal quality, and crew, definitely made up for outward flightThank you BAThe airline isn\xe2\x80\x99t badTheir boarding procedure was very good, though the aircraft was very oldI know it is one of the oldest, and personally I enjoyed itIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to hop to London, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect any kind of special treatment or service.The IFE was decent and had a good selectionThe cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to usFlight left close to on timeService was quick as we were first served at the backAdequate amount of food served and was tastyIce cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flightIt was okLess drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this timePaid for the BA seat selection early to get good seatsThe overall flight wasn\'t too badBoarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with GatwickExcellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party loungeGoodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food optionsFast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving HeathrowIFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flightReturning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendlyKept very clean and plenty of foodAn upgrade to biz was nice on a full flightEfficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu serviceA really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from HeathrowAn early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy(currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and I even liked Gatwick!!I was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly Flight AttendantsThey walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kindsI will definitely fly British overseas again given a chanceThe economy seats on this old but well kept Boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and I am a 5\'9" x 240lbs and still did not feel crampedI would encourage all my friends to fly British if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the US to EuropeThank You British Airways, very good service indeed.I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprisedShortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to readNot long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tastyThe crew were very attentive and helpfulThey had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip pastThe seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fineThis flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it againI paid around 6500 avios and an extra \xc2\xa313 in taxes which I think was very good value for what I had.The budget airlines can do better at lower cost.I was originally booked in World Traveller Plus but at Dulles check-in was offered a Club World upgrade at just $499 more which I accepted - resulting flight was verycomfortable with good food and top-drawer serviceThe two London-Bucharest sectors both went wellOn arrival in London I was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of T5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of anotherClub World upgrade (this time for free)They were as professional and proactive a crew as I\'ve ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travelFinally, once arrived at Dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cabWhat could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years I\'ve hadmostly excellent experiences with BA cabin crews and that\'s a big reason why I\'ve stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do soBut a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above-and-beyond service - you\'re the best.But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parkingBoarding was on time and according to BA\'s new group allocationOur seats - 2K and 3K - were a first for us, as we\'ve previously gone for pairs in the centreBut seats A and K are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacyBut at least it didn\'t require rebooting on our flightFood was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfastBA flies one of its oldest B747 into Miami and it showed even in firstThe service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of CaliforniaThe only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful, quiet Airbus A380Airline assured me everything was fineI put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodnessAsking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seatRaised a formal complaint and was told that they \'understand my frustration\' which is niceLovely flight and a great BA Worldwide Crew, which are the best in the BA fleetVery good seat with great extras that you would expect in 1st ClassChose to sleep as it was a night flight, but had a delicious full breakfast in the morningBaggage allowance was superb with 3 x 32Kg cases and 2 cabin bagsOverall, a lovely flight, with a great airline, that has a great crewI had the Gourmet Dining consisting of braised Hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and deliciousroute, I highly recommend you to go for it.Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn\'t a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and winewas good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium EconomyI should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra \xc2\xa3400 for the upgradeThis was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QFOn Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choicesSome smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuffYou would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offeredI am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planesPut the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will rememberFlying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraftThe B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fineVery comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney homeCheck in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas)One or two interesting things and some new releasesCome on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classicsAs for music: well I\'m 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the worldI wish to highly commend here, despite alone she managed perfectly.Crew was friendlyBritish airways has one big advantage though: the generous hand luggage rules.Cabin crew were efficientI remember them as not a "top of the line" airline, but better than averageIt was lucky we still had the one we printed out at homeI figured this was tight but all the while manageable since I trusted BA\'s systemIf you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because it\'s much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo Luckily I\'ve made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connectionCheck-in at Vienna Airport was painlessBA uses Air Lounge at Vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okayI found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk toHaving a window seat on the top deck your kind of rest assured you will have privacy and restThis was successful on the flight with 6 hours slept which was super comfortable which I was surprised atThe meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for BAAll flights on time, clean aircraft, food good, cabin crew friendly I recommend British AirwaysHowever my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both waysOn this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn\'t feel the need toAlthough I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (inWas given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fussA380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise ofThis was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to HK on an A350 on Cathay Pacific and the difference was hugeThey also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage areaDrinks selection was very goodPlus points go to the cabin crew, who were very professional and had a sense of humourA380 both sectors, awesome aircraftFirstly, BA flight deck crews are awesomeTotally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professionalTheir service was excellentOn the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints thereThe seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt crampedOther than that, the overall BA experience was totally acceptable.Long flight to Abu Dhabi was ok, no frills in Premium Economy but edible foodReturn flight was similar, but Heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this timeMy last flight on BA was over 30 years ago, it was a real premium carrier then.Plane ready near enough on time with well organized boardingFlew club Europe and the crew were excellentFriendly, attentive and professionalThe food was a good standardThink they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service.No spaces at the spa, Galleries lounges were fine and showers cleanGood WiFiAircraft was a 777-300 so in flight entertainment was goodCrew experienced and were goodService prompt, food reasonable and I liked the new White Company offeringsGenerally a solid performance.The main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly, and hard workingMy most recent BA experience was positiveOn my most recent flight from Miami to LHR I found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the dated aircraft the 747-400Which to me is the legend of the skies! The cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service,Food and beverage service was good, seating in my aisle seat 29E generous for my long legsWell done BA you excel against the North American carriers on routes to the North American gateways who give just a basic service.The only redeeming thing was that it was cheaper than competitors (but still not cheap).I saw some passengers request for more food, and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitudeI must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFKI flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and aIn my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional chargeEven if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experienceMy partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead lockerelse, as a measure of our appreciation, we\'ll take away your leg room"The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mentionYoung adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant serviceThe stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstandingLanding was smoothAll looked good when I got to the airport customer services counter - was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to callFinally get through to BA and they finally agree to put me back to K2 to get the bag offeredEfficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flightGalleries South lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite goodShowers clean and well presentedWell presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drinkUnable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptableEfficient staff and good inflight entertainmentHappy with whole experienceI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to sleep it was fine.All in all it was an education, certainly taught me a lesson!Check-in was friendlyTake-off was on timeDrinks and food service served efficientlyLucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn\'t fullOn board service was decentProfessional, courteous and friendly attendantsFlat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleepHowever, from the moment I arrived at the check in desk in Tampa I was met with the utmost courtesy and assistanceFrom the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptionalEvery person was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possibleI witnessed such kindness and this is what I have come to expect and value from British AirwaysI had booked economy, was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded when I checked in online Priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker rangeThe inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wineM&S food service was OKCheck-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn\'t have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusiveConcorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some placesSeat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacketThe TV screen seemed quite large and high qualitySoon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I likeArabic starter was greatMeal was of good quality and cooked wellBedding was of good quality and comfortable enoughOverall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the productThe crew were very friendly and professionalI managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.The staff were pleasantBreakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequateI was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbookedBritish Airways flight manager is very professionalHer information was very clear, trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on thisVery much appreciated for their service.London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is one of BA\'s new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekersBut there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved Club World food service with plates brought individually to one\'s seat, and arrival aheadOverall, an entirely reasonable flight.I had to say something, to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights I have ever hadThis is old school airline service, puts the glamour and luxury back into air travelI loved the humour, the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes.Words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make sure I was comfortable on my latest flight; but here it goes! Iwas very sick/nauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off British Airways literally nursed me back to healthThey were beyond wonderful and were genuinely caring and concernedI never once felt like a burden, even though they were checking on me often! World class crew!! Again, so thankful for people like this, especially in my time ofneed and would highly recommend this airline to everyone.The cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which I have filled inWhile I understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and I liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need), itVery interesting experience.Service at the British Airways business class counter at Beijing airport was pleasantOnboard, service was really good, quite personal and attentive, which made a difference from the service on the way out to BeijingFood was as good a you\'d expect to get on board, I managed to get a window seat, which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep onEntertainment options were good.There were many drinks available, wine was okThe entertainment that was available was good.Another regular flight by British Airways, which has turned into a low cost airline, given the total no frills service they provideThe staff are extremely nice and polite, but in the short haul flights you only get luggageThe flight went perfectly, departing and arriving on time.Very full flight on G-BNLP/B747 flying from Miami to LondonFelt like a teenager againBA have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothlyThe service was very good, attentive and promptThe food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert and cheese course with drinks flowing, frankly well above expected.The crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers, but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being thereHowever, the check-in lady was nice and we had a laughThe pilot and captain were top class - the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours - but they made it up to 2 hours and was smoothMeals - excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked businessI am a frequent traveller but this was the first time I have traveled with British Airways and it did not disappoint meThe cabin crews were wonderful and the service were greatThe seat aren\'t the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for money is good too.Boarding was smooth and we left on timeIFE was fineCrew good.\r\nDecided to pay to travel First class for a big birthdaymeal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of meI love BA onboard crew in general but I will never fly BA again.Those have been pretty goodGround service in Edinburgh was outstandingExpeditious, friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra chargeDeparture was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier, so very wellApart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on timeThe best thing about this flight from London Heathrow to Miami was it\xe2\x80\x99s punctualityWe have flown similar routes on Thomas Cook and TUI planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this BA flight, which I thinkFor most of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this timeTerminal 5 Heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate The flight was smooth, the seat significantly more comfortable than Jet\'s, the food good, and the service greatThe steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritativeCheck-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positiveThe staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concernsWe had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight)What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between Ryanair and BA again please? Ah, the price! The only reason I give 2/10 is because the plane has reclining seats and got us there safely.I have an interview to attend which is very importantMeal offered was goodThe old 777s they use out of Gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortableThe food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receivenice alternatives out thereCheck in was fast and efficient as was the boarding processI really like the new Group boarding structureThe lunch offered on board was goodCabin crew were very attentiveOverall very good with the exception of late arrival of luggage.Very satisfied with BA, Reasonable fares, on time, awesome cabin staff, going to the UK they are my favourite airlineI really enjoyed my flight from London to JohannesburgThe aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and politeAs I have grown older I have found long haul flights less tolerable so I was not really looking forward to this flight, however I was very pleasantly surprised andwill definitely use British Airways on that route again.As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkinsToilets were maintained well in all 3 flightsI had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life, my 50th birthdayOn this occasion, I had invested in an upgrade and as such I expected nothing lessOur investment in our staff, our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service.\xe2\x80\x9d The experience with BA has resulted inFood was OK, this is coach, so no really high expectationsPlane was clean, flight attendants were friendlyThe IFE worked flawlessly, good selection of programsBA did a good job.Overall a flight with no problemsThe ground and air staff was good.Check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding processBreakfast offered on board was good and tastyOverall good flight and service.Pre-flight drinks served okMeal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tastySeat was comfortable, if snugReturn overnight flight left Tobago on timeOld school FAs on board - attentive, capable, unobtrusiveBreakfast ok and flight arrived slightly earlyCabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the serviceFinally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claimBoarding at Heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policyI found all three courses exceptional and very well cookedThe staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flightI know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown withVery nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BAI also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in clubThere rapid response and actions probably saved his life, I flew on 12 JanuaryWell done BA, you are pulling in the right direction again.\xe2\x80\x9cTo fly, to serve\xe2\x80\x9d, a very well respected mottoBritish Airways is always a good choiceI was flying business class from LGW to FCO, everything was excellent!

No complaints from meJust hope they have more offers for Business Class.Outbound flight from Londiin City was fineBoarding was quick and smooth, flight was not too busyNice crew, on time departure and a breakfast tray, which I did not expectNo complaintsFlight a little delayed on the return leg but all-in-all was goodmodels) but the service, food, check-in, luggage allowance etc was all goodNice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flightWould still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London CityThe advantage of London City is, apart from the distance to London, that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride.You used to be such a wonderful airline, flying our country\'s colours proudly and we were proud of you, it\'s almost laughable at the errors you have committed to yourThe seats were very comfortable and completely functionalThe cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kindThe food for dinner, while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenienceThe breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offeredOverall, an extremely pleasant experiencean okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flightReturning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde loungeExcellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food \xe2\x80\x93all choices availableThe crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smartLong haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flightschanges faster to retain premium customers.Addicted to cutsPerfect partner for AAI really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from T3 to LHR T5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazyAnd to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Expressbooking so feeling goodEven Ryanair allows a bag of duty free onOnce we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I\'d flown with them)The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around \xc2\xa3130 more thanEmirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journeyThe A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requestedBA has been taken over for air travel by the big middle Eastern airlines, but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again - long haulI agreeI booked a flight on another airline and for just \xc2\xa3200 more, I got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant.Cabin crew was very attentive and efficientService was excellentBA does not have the best first class product, but their staff is the best in EuropeFood was tasteful and wine selection was superbI had very good 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at LHRLooking forward to flying with them again in January.Today was special thoughIFE was good and the meal wasn\xe2\x80\x99t badThe seats were comfy and felt quite spacious, however I am quite a small personGlasses of champagne/wine offered on arrival, and the food was quite goodThe attendants were politeInflight entertainment was decent, I especially liked the "Festive Season" section, which had a variety of holiday/Christmas moviesPlane left and arrived on timeHaving had several negative experiences with British Airways in the past, I was pleasantly surprised with this flight.The staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 USD to buy essential items and that is sufficient inOvernight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through T5B747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updatedThe food was OKIt was good for only a short haul journeycomfortable! Other airlines offer snacks throughout the journeyHowever, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situationThe only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are goodThey are better and more responsive.Great flight out from London to SantiagoLovely, friendly crewGoats cheese salad to start, fish pie for main, good selection of wines and managed 7 hrs sleep on way out and even longer coming back! 787-900 is a fantasticFlying this aircraft to Seychelles in May and really looking forward to itIt\'s been a while since I last flew on BA and it certainly has changedAll things considered, that is understandable.London to Seattle, a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain aboutEfficient and professional service, meal service fine, good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extraGood experience all round and nothing much to complain aboutFA\'s efficient and friendly, flight was on timeWe were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus areaThis gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great serviceSummarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us outSurprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggageWe can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.The only saving grace is that I\'ve never experienced any issues flying out of or into T5Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-overIt looks a bit betterLooked freshly cleanedAirborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was niceWines were okVery pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WCThe flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost \xc2\xa38.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth ofI\'d agree with thatDeparted bang on timeJust niceRed wine was OK - mid priced stuff at about \xc2\xa325 a bottleFlight was smooth all the way homeBoarding was well controlled and the breakfast food served onboard was very goodI was also impressed by the fast and efficient serviceOverall very good flight and service.they let me buy a \xc2\xa31000 new flightHave flown this route a number of times with British Airways, but this was my first experience with the new Club World offerings (White Company bedding, improved catering, refurbished 747The new improvements are excellent, particularly the cateringBoth the presentation and the taste of the new food is a significant step above the previous Club World catering offering and the new \xe2\x80\x98pick your starter and desert\xe2\x80\x99 optionsfrom the display trolley is a real nice touchThe new bedding makes the Club World bed much more comfortable to sleep on.I make sure to tell all my friends about this experience.Just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console, was a pleasure to fly with a great airline like British AirwaysThe staff were friendly and happy to assist me, the gentlemen made a call and while this was happening the air hostess appeared with my console in handThis has really made me appreciate flying with a high quality airlineFuture flights to Madeira are most certainly going to be with British Airways.Then a British airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat numberMany years ago it was one of the european flagship carriers and it was fun to fly BA, now it\'s just another shrinking violet.It might be excellent innovation back in mid 2000s but the industry has moved on.Fly the route often, usually with Qantas which are greatThe no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolleyNeedless to say, Eurowings and EasyJet do things much better.Boarding at Miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! So muchThe only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crewI can report a positive experience on our flightFrom the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughoutThe menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cookedTalking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flightTake-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalismAn excellent flight, overall.cabin and stylish serviceThe fare was also pretty goodCome on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hrI have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinksOut of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desertright behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steakOther than that it was this time a decent mealBA could be so much betterThe stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers facenice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite longThe seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage spaceIt was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watchThe food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very wellAside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and specialIt would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business classOn arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quickOverall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in IsraelI used Avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money.Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular ratherwhich were quite tastylike a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernisingSmiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without anyThe regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher qualityWhilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easierThese seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and accessis showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of serviceOthers however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experienceFood and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yetOverall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as I booked using Avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for moneyFortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was goodLuckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politelyBoth aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for usBoarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managedWe were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good timeWe were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get aroundWe decided to give it a shot regardlessLuckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no chargePlane at T5 Satellite C, so used B Galleries Lounge, which was quiet and pleasantEfficient boarding, seats 50J/K on upper deck, which provided good privacy despite proximity to toiletsMixed crew FAs and ours were young and enthusiasticIn-flight service good, with a notable improvement in the quality of food, i.e., courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crispBreakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usualOverall, a good flight, although we look forward to promised improvements in 2018.Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a goodLuckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the endEventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check inOn this occasion I had a very warm crew for which I appreciatedAs a Brit, I was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for Christmas on board the relatively new B787The fare I paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a J class cabin - in my viewOn this flight good choice of foods with attentive staffTicket booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for \xc2\xa32.5k in business class return so very good valuePositives - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFECabin quiet and crew amazingly helpfulT5 Lounge fine, flight on timeIn previous years food been excellentReturn journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpfulThey were amazingThe crew lift this product to a much higher level.Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges)The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swiftSoon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flightThe service was good, considering a one hour flightCabin crew generally helpful and friendlyThe alcoholic drinks were all pleasantThe food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some goodthe floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thinHave received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past.Excellent information from the flight deckCabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lotNow, they do little more than a low-cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in Europe.British Airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their gameThe service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experiencedThe quality of the food served had lifted materiallyThe staff were helpfulAnother couple of centimetres would be welcomeOverall, a better BA experience. First class check in at T7 in JFK was quick, polite staff provide better service than those at HeathrowSelected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tastyBoarding was reasonably efficient,  and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks, pyjamas etc 90 minutes before arrival I had some fruits and pastry for breakfast,  accompanied by some good coffeeWhile I only needed minimal service onboard, the staff were courteous and efficient, and they are one of very few good things left after BA after their CEO seems toI was able to secure a window seat for myself (without paying any fee) during online check-in 24 hours prior to departureThe baggage drop-off experience at LAX and LHR was smoothThe on-board experience was goodThere was no WiFi, but BA had a good collection of moviesI enjoyed BA\'s in-flight "movie snack" as wellOverall, I had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with BA again.Gatwick to Cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affairThe website was easy to use and very clearThe boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was cleanMy seat was comfortable for a short flightThe captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew I could see worked very hard and were pleasantThe crew made use of Italian and were cheerful and professionalThe lavatory was cleanDisembarkation was managed well.Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y classThis was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirableOakland to Heathrow and this flight was fineLeft and arrived on timeFA attentive and professionalFood reasonable and alcohol served in generous proportionsCabin crew were kindThis is the only positive thingWhen I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girlThe flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this timeIt could learn well from airlines like Singapore Airlines which are pretty consistent and cleanBoarding well organisedFlight fine, ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpitDidn\xe2\x80\x99t buy anything this time, smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experienceI do still like flying BA as much as I don\xe2\x80\x99t Easy or RyanairPros - 23kgs cabin bag allow best in the business.The decor and layout of the facility is greatPlane left on timeThe front row made it easier - but only justHad a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous saladPlane landed on timeThe Captain came out and I had a nice chat with himVery nice blokeIt looked nice thoughGreat flight back into the setting sunFAs on all flights were greatI first flew BA in 1980 and what a differenceImpressed with the legroom on the Embraer 190 (much more comfortable than BA\'s A320s)Check-in, security and boarding all went smoothly and quicklyCabin crew were efficientWould fly with BA again on short sectors, and LCY is an excellent airport to use.The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn\xe2\x80\x99t amazingI am 6\xe2\x80\x99 tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable spaceThe cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficientThat being said it tasted very niceArriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airportAlthough the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quickIt took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painlessI got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feelOne of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew serviceBest part of the trip was getting offGood on time flight with usual impeccable pilotFlight was a good price.Our return trip from holiday was equally pleasantIn board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew - chatted to the First Officer, nice manAll in all we were well looked after in this Class so can\'t complain.New lounge in South Terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality, although sadly, the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracksA319 to Malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good qualityWe arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complainOverall flight quality has to be excellent.world\xe2\x80\x99s favourite airline by far)I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was availableThe food was nice and the seat was very comfortablePretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good valueCheck in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quickThe new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmacIt was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably goodStaff were all excellentBoarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offeredThis was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn\xe2\x80\x99t show much sign of ageI was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than mostThe cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredientsOverall a good flight.Online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okayBoarding quite efficientI was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected Particularly for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good educationflights? That was one of the things I appreciated most about BA as it made me feel valuedIn contrast to the outgoing flight, this was a flight to be endured - just shows what a difference the crew can make.The staff that looked after us flying out to Florida and home were outstanding, on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate fromwhich they were happy to doThe seats were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep, the only thing we weren\xe2\x80\x99t to happy with was the movies but IAll in all I would book to fly with BA again and would highly recommend.On board the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabinThe crew were friendly and helpful but I couldn\'t help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into SwitzerlandApart from those things the flight was on time, punctual and served the purpose which I paid for.Galleries South in T5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelledthis airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 minsThe lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing awayEfficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offeredEarly arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfastThe crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept goingFinal flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flyingAt the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business classNo signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cartThe main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges)My early morning flight from Gatwick to Malaga was a very pleasant experience overallThe flight departed on time and was staffed by competent and amiable and very experienced cabin crewAnnouncements were clear and friendlyThe outboard leg was very good from London to Bulgaria, the check in was swift and efficient, boarding the flight was simple and quickDisembarking off the plane was straight forward and easyThe flight was worth a good 8 out of 10Overall I would give this leg 4 out of 10.Forget about a welcome drink before take off, 3 course dinner (was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight) and personalized serviceLuckily, I am leaving the USA to Asia from Los Angeles next week on Eva Air and expecting a big step up in standards.Lucia was a good experienceI don\'t have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals andThe seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regularIn-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lotthan necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the otherFlight left on time and the plane was clean and modernThe crew were friendlyWe were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminalThe BA offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy.The aircraft was cleanCabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goodsThe main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from UK to Tirana, otherwise nothing special to recommendExpect a budget airline experience hereStaff were very friendly and helpful howeverPilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info.Aircraft long haul new and clean, short haul a bit old, but still acceptableCrew overall are lovely, pleasant serviceBA food is on the top of the rankAlso very tastyAgain, it flavorfulIf I knew before, I will book a premium economy, that one seems nicer and have more spaceI got the best price for round trip, value for money!Boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly earlyThe sale of food and drinks went well and didn\'t appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hourCrew were good.The plane on both flights was an Airbus 321 and I\xe2\x80\x99d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interiorI am 1.82m (6 feet) tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine \xe2\x80\x93 I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel cramped even in the centre seatThe cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteousOn both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progressIt might seem like a minor gripe but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if I have to pay for(The coffee, by the way, was excellent)Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was cleanHowever the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landedBoth flights were safe and competentI am a one world emerald member on AA so I get certain perks when flying British Airways such as free seat selection, lounge use and priority boarding - thatmakes this airline bearable - justBA are listed as a 4 star airline,  AA are a 3 star yet AA now have better inflight service than BA by a country mileCabin crew comment, you have extra legroom arent you lucky ,my comment - yes and I paid for it when I asked about lack of pocket for my specs andArrived on timeReturn flight was on timePunctuality was BAs saving grace.In the positive side, cabin crew were professional and politeCockpit announcements very informativeFood is decent quality, but the presentation, at least in PE, could be improvedCabin crew were professional and attentive throughoutLunch service definitely improved, although the lacto-ovo-vegetarian main course was the usual bland, overcooked pastaAmazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no optionsHad a very nice flight with good cabin service and informative cockpit crewFirst time to experience a 375 ml bottle of champagne on the drinks trolley which was chilled for meTerminal 5 is a nice place to start any trip and would choose BA for my next holiday.After that very good flight againMuch busier Club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very attentiveAgain the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chatKids in dire need, ok, adults No! Time made up almost, T5 quite quick again so another good experience for us with BAFirst time I flew from Belfast and it\'s a great little airportI had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty goodThe bar was well stocked including Fever Tree tonic and Grey Goose vodkaChampagne was available on requestwas managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminalThe flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengersBut as a Gold member I got most of the business class benefits.Toronto to London Heathrow and was very pleasantly surprisedGreat window seats overlooking tarmacMeal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle barDrink choices perfectly adequateStaff very helpful and cordialFlight left half an hour late but made up time and landed earlyCabin staff were extremely friendly and helpfulThat said, seats fully reclined, I had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortableCost of flight was 30-50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very goodAs a side note connected on to Madrid and BA lounges at LHR are fantasticBoarding on time, greeted warmlyFrom take off the Purser looked after the business cabin brilliantlyDrinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without askingWine topped up regularlyAll through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabinThe crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humorI booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatableWe were seated on the top deck and I was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle seats)The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etcFood was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals)Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the wayOn our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail windAgain we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovelyFood was again just okI spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn\'t be more helpfulShe found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after thatcommenting how good he had been throughout the flightShe really made what could have been a stressful situation much easier and her positive friendly attitude really helped me outI was pleasently surprised by BA on both legs of our journey and I wouldn\'t hesitate to book with them again, just a shame they can\'t up their game foodA continental/charcuterie option would go down a treat on this route, I imagine, but we had a choice of flaccid English breakfast or flaccid omeletteI can see why this is the bargain fare, but still better than several competitorsI felt safe, we arrived early, the crew were (for the most part) friendlySo a couple of hours later I\'m a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where I find some quite pleasant snacksI was not too disappointed thoughThe flights were smooth and left on time, seating fairly comfortable, consider is was a 80 minute flightPre-board and on board announcements were efficient and informativeCome on BA, get your act together, or at least like a quote I once read, "we are like British Rail love, we may be late, but we\'re getting there".Boarding in London was efficient and orderlyI have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from A to B for a competitive priceThe planes were clean and modernThe crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flightLondon Heathrow to Keflavik was a good experienceThe meals served was very good with a simple starter, decent hot main course and tasty dessertThere was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flightThe senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for youOn the flight I was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seatThe cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juiceThe food was of good quality so it was, despite the delay, a good experienceOn the return, boarding was swift and efficient, and the cabin staff, once again, friendly and helpfulFood not as interesting as on the outward leg, but perfectly acceptableI usually try to take a cheaper flight, involving connections, but this direct flight was well worth the extra expense.I flew JAL on the way out and the service was superb and meals deliciousService was efficient, bordering on perfunctoryLuckily we brought some other food on boardCheck in was easy thanks to fast help from the check-in deskThe staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of timeThe welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor)However, the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay, and the current progress in making up the lost timeOverall the flight was pretty regular from BA, but the good ground staff, useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew, made it a good service.They were once smart and full of energyare far better than BA first classCabin Crew from JFK was excellent, to Cape Town was passableManaged to get upper deck which is rare flying from London to PhiladelphiaA positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the futureAll staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendlyThe meals were actually really niceMy criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flightMy criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future.Nice to London Heathrowwhat was a great airline.Athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people - albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain / claimBA are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew - without them I\'d have already desertedLunch was ok for this short sectorIn summary all was okAs I mentioned, I have been one of their luckier passengers.The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceasesThe meal was of a reasonable quality and well presentedI can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at DusseldorfChasse croissant which looked if it had seen better daysThe A380 has to be my favorite long haul aircraft, but BA is definitely notCabin crew were friendly and professional, despite not being a full complement of crewclass really is! BA\'s golden years are well and truly over, it will take a miracle to bring them back!Premium Economy very spacious with 38 inch seat pitch, very good IFEThe 2 crew serving this section were excellent: polite, engaging and funAmenity kits appreciatedChicken curry was delicious- my brother and fellow traveller both advised their steaks were the best they had eaten on an airlineImpressed with warm bread rollsPlenty of wineOutward from London to Johannesburg the upper-deck Premium Economy cabin on A380 is very personal and much more spacious and quieter than on Boeing 747 aircraftNice wide selection on IFEOnce again excellent, young and polite crewBeef steak asparagus dinner and orange chocolate dessert was deliciousOverall a very good experience and would recommend BA.Flying premium economy on Cathay Pacific is dramatically superiorOn the departure date, we checked smoothly at the business class counter at LHRThe fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problemI checked and it was true, but I had not suspected it at all till that point, since I had paid for business class, believed that everything was in orderHowever, the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft firstNice to London HeathrowThey had a good old chat at the front one even deciding it was time to snoozeFor a 700 dollar 45 minute flight we should get betterDefinately a low cost airline nowThe wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, WestjetOn Westjet, you purchase your food, but I\'m sure it has to be superior to BA\'s offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superiorAir France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only redeeming factor on this flight was the Airbus 380, still the smoothest and quietestBritish Aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world, well known for outstanding inflight service, decent food, comfortable seats, good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalledIn fact, I\'ve had superior travel experiences on some budget carriersFlying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it\'s a wonderful aircraftNo snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every waybe among the best of airlines.It was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we\'ll just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into the ticketStarted well with BA at last choosing a gate where they can process excess hand luggage prior to the final gate check (gate 27 - rather than the far gatesIt was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into Accra a little earlyA first for me in 18 years on the route! Once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendlyI had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and they did a much better jobThe selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was niceThe lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract loungeWe received the magic beep and were upgraded to Club Europe (both of us are Gold members)All very tasty but I do miss the scones in Club EuropeI also managed two top ups of champagneThe cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requestedThe flight arrived on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes of landingI will be flying ABBA (anything but BA) from now on.A superb flight from Heathrow to Boston, even though it was the day the latest BA strike started (19th July)Seats on B777-300 comfortable with plenty of legroom in the bassinet seatsCabin crew thoughtful and highly professional and there were regular considerate, reassuring updates from the cockpitFood really pretty good - dropping the second meal on this route is not a problem for meEntertainment not bad at allHad a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the bags to arrive in the airportAll BA crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for BA, I would happily fly with them again soon.We were through very quickly as there was no queue at securityThe former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tastyThe drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although I don\'t drink the stuff the choice looked extensiveI tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can\'t remember what it was called but it was very niceFinally I couldn\'t resist a shot of Johnnie Walker BlueBut if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific loungeThe flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on timeCabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the BoB offeringReally appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flightDespite a lot of moans about BA on this forum I can\'t really complain about the overall experienceAs a Gold member the lounge access was freeWe did a return trip from Heathrow to JFK and there were only two good things about flying British Airways, you can use the entertainment system from the start andwe liked Terminal Five at HeathrowThe return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complainInflight entertainment was fine, lots of films both new and old to watchFortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seatFortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situationThe good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderfulFlight deck very informative about slight delayIt is quite a short flight and the fare was low so cannot complain too much, but BA is now no different to EasyJet, flybe etc.That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it\xe2\x80\x99s a winOnce on board the crew were friendly and professionalThe cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in BA\'s club classGot us there fineFood was okay and I was pleasantly surprisedCrew members were hard working, polite and professionalThe Boeing 777-200was showing signs of age (G-VIIW ) but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year, this plane appeared more cared forOverall the experience was good on this occasionFlight was on time and ground service was smoothLuckily I\'ve got some water and treats from the airport shopsEfficient check in, third party lounge at Mauritius airport was a reasonable place to spend time before the flight with usual facilitiesOn time departure, welcomed with warm glass of champagne! Cabin ok though was a little grubby in placesReasonable breakfastAfter a 12 hours + flight this would have been quite welcome.Seat was finePlane arrived on time which was a relief as I had to change terminals to catch a connectionI was glad when the four hour flight ended - nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that.The 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights (they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the A380)The seatback TV and in-flight entertainment had been significantly upgradedThe cabin crew was polite, professional, and accommodating \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0no complaints thereThe captain even gave us a personal, genuine announcement before takeoff, which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a long-haul flightThe flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours, 59 minutes, and without delay on either endgreat job.I used to admire and love BAI think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying Club Europewith blessingshave to keep doing this? The trip as such started well enough in the new BA South Terminal Lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks, foodby some rather merry Club Europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge (though not exclusively for BA use) that they had been able to access and enjoy!Club Europe passengers were amongst the first to be called, so that did not look too badIt is not the money, it is the principle.BA Economy is on a par with RyanairBusiness is okayFast track worked wellOnboard all flights, the domestic and European biz class is fineSeats with decent legroom, choice of food (chicken salad, charcuterie and cheese) and good quality drinksThe staff were lovely, professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectorsCrew from GVA-LHR particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrivalOverall, the short haul business product is perfectly adequate, if for nothing other than skipping queuesBA\'s lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors, but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job.Terminal 5 is one of the best terminals at Heathrow and as we were connecting from a long haul flight from Asia on another carrier we were a bit tiredBut the staff greeted us with a smile, the plane felt nice and seat was comfortableWhich we found to be comparatively good value for money and quite goodI like the BA service touchIt manages to be both nice and efficientWe had a nice smooth flight home to Iceland at the end of our vacation and I can honestly say that I\'m looking forward to my next flight with BA.I was a bit nervous when I booked my Bristish Airways return flight from London - Tokyo, but I had a really pleasant experienceThe flight attendants were lovely, attentive, prompt and sweetThe food was good, plenty of in-flight movie options and the pilot was very reassuringGood points: the cabin crew were reasonably good, toilets were clean, and the in-flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection, but that wasn\'t enough to save this from beingcutting the shareholders are very happyThe check in and lounge were of a reasonable standard and the new lounge at Gatwick is niceBoarding was fine and pre-selected seats retainedIn short acceptable serviceFlight left and arrived on timeBritish Airways was once the flagship airline of the UK, you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the restSo, another 20 minutes later, I spoke to another (very caring and helpful) BA agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost +\xc2\xa3500 ontoHad changed seats to row 12 (emergency) loads of legroom and row in front can\'t recline, so it was very comfortableGood flightRow 12 not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on BA, a better seat on a new plane, a decent free snack and a nice small bottleof wine also free! So a good experienceBA are one rung about Ryanair and on par with Easyjet when it comes to customer service and deliveryConvenient flight times and LHR departure is as good at it gets I\'m afraid.Would strongly recommend taking own food on BA short haul flights.All was going well (which in Accra means an orderly boarding), got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the standInitially I was very impressed when I spied the M&S food and drink menu which does merit appreciationJust landed from the second of two flights in First between London and Kuala Lumpur and on both legs, the experience was exceptionalChose seats 1E and 1F on both legs for my partner and I, and seats were clean, well maintained, fully functioning and very comfortableGround service at T5 is a vast improvement with the new First Wing; passed through quickly and met by attentive staff, with prompt and professional service in the Concorde RoomGolden Lounge at Kuala Lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menuOnboard the staff on both legs were professional, friendly, intuitive, attentive and good natured, and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requestsFlowers in the bathroom (which was kept clean, though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times) and amuse bouche providedPlenty of wine, no shortage of food and nothing ran out - my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having toThese flights reminded of why we fly with BA and remain loyal to them.Air France and KLM probably offer a better business class service on this routeA service which was very good before the cost cuttingWe arrived in time at the airportCheck in was quick and friendlyIt was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blindsBrand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food, drink and magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminalMy special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flightGiven the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was greatTo be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example)Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than thatLovelySecurity was slow, so fast track was appreciatedTransfer at Heathrow was a breeze, surprisingly with no further security checkBoarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck, with a pleasant greeting from the crewThe premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroomWe both ordered beef fillet for dinner - alternative was chicken - which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutleryArrival was on time and everything went smoothlyMore space and full service on a one hour flight.The Bangkok to London route is served by B777 aircraft that look like they\'ve seen better daysThe food served is okService on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg, with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to theThe short haul flights between London and Luxembourg (in economy) were goodThe salt in the wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day inI sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London HeathrowWill continue to book BA for cheap economy (product/service offers almost no difference) and enjoy upgrades where given.Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airportThe lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine listEasy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to LondonThe crew on this flight were greatYoung, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professionalThe underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&CMixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effortBritish Airways crews special and outstandingOnce we were finally on-board the flight was trouble freeGood servicePlane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delayIt\'s at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staffService was okay food economy standard although included in the priceQatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better serviceThis was the first time we had flown British Airways since the move to the south terminal, check in was quick and progress through security also without delayBoarding on time, cabin crew in Club Europe were very pleasant and efficient as I always find with BAMeal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight, three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter, Thyme Roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake, washed down with aOverall a good flight.However, the price I paid was at a low-cost level as well, so the value for money is OK.My son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm beforeThe staff at BA were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice toucheasyjet and Ryanair offer superior, and on long haul its got to the point I will now fly Virgin and others, again offer more for your money in all aspectsNo better than economyI know where I will be taking my custom in future.Check-in experience was quite good with friendly staff member at Istanbul airport who took my portable phone charger from meThe seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class, the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphonesI was upgraded to WT+ at the gate, owing to a full flight and probably being an Emerald with oneworldI can now distil the difference in service/product with economy on the same route - with WT+ you will receive one amenity pack (eyeshades, socks, toothbrush), one welcome drink ("cavameaty dish for the main dinner (I am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian, which was the traditional BA carby pasta from WT, which was fine)I enjoyed the IFE, the crew were nice and the flight on timeFood ok, seat comfy but had seen better days and needed re-upholsteringCompensation claim into BA rather a lot - hopefully all gets paidThe Boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean, and the Premium Economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight, with good recline, although unfortunately there is no legrestThe IFE system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlinesWe flew out of terminal 5 on Saturday with British Airways to Brussels, and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly, we even had a nice chat with aWe used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was goodI did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free waterAt all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catchThis delay was not BA s fault, and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficientI enjoyed the flight but hope that BA do not make any further cuts, and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day.Out World Traveller+ (premium economy) which was not too badAs the aircraft had been sitting at JNB for most of the day, there were no delays and boarding started very earlyTop quality service, whatever may have declined in economy class, premium economy is as good as ever with 38in leg-room and meals (really tasty in this instance) that can beThe cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabinSmooth connections at Terminal 5 with no waiting (either way) and Tribute Cornish Ale available on the long haul drinks menu, and service is a winner(I\'ll admit the M&S food/drink service can be a bit time-consuming as far as handling the payments, but works OK otherwise.) British Airways continue to deliver a first-rate travel experience,and I\'m sticking with them.Having used BA Business / Club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holidayIt was the fist time I traveled with British Airways and I believe it will be the lastBritish Airways has won the race to the bottomI fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior to BA\'s FirstA crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of teaThe return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technologyAll minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with BA, points that made us choose them, small points that made the differenceThe pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyondFor me their USP was their service, without that there is no longer a point.London to Seoul flight was very pleasantCabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentiveFood and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high-quality menu choicesThe seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some, however there is a fold-down seat/step in front of you that you have to use to ableInflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releasesLuckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flightI had a connecting flight to catch to Manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as I had just over an hour after landing to make itThe flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing jobStaff brilliant, including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he couldWe were lucky to find swissair flight home or I think we\'d still be there!New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidaysFA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flightRecommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you\'re travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short personOn the way home we didn\'t mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the loungeVery fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven\'t travelled long-haul with BAI\'d only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price onI fly British Airways a fair amount mainly for pleasureIn fact I have experienced far better service on EasyJetFlight was smooth enough, efficient but boarded 15mins late in EdinburghGreat flight from London to Kuala Lumpur on the Boeing 787-9The crew were amazing and friendly and couldn\'t have done enoughThe food served was of good standard and we were asked a few times if we would like more drinksOne crew member who said she had been with BA for many years was professional and excellent at her job.I was looking forward to this flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck used to be such a treat! IFirstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every wayNothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their workBritish Airways flight attendents are cordial and professionalThis made these long flights bearableWhen people are using the flight safety card to fan themselves, you know it is warmLondon Heathrow to San Francisco return and pleasantly surprised with the serviceAll flights were on time and arrived ahead of scheduleFood was excellent - particularly on outbound flightMy partner is vegetarian, and we both opted for vegetarian Hindu meal which proved to be deliciousAircraft in good order and cleanCabin crew - particularly on way out - were professional, attentive and friendlyInflight entertainment choice was generally good, offering something for everyoneThis was generally a positive experience.The first flight was slightly delayed, but our transfer time was more then 3 hours, so that didn\'t cost any problemThe cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to HNDTheir service was greatWe did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensatedDespite this damaged suitcase it was handled greatThat\'s what made the difference to me.Check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than Gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airsideThe new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn\'t use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa\'sThe bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of foodBoarding was on timeIn my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerablyBreakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful I understood whyAnd Qatar Airways ground service staff show that they do care.I was pleasantly surprised with British Airways on both outbound and inbound flights from Orlando to Gatwick after reading the reviewsThe crew both ways were friendly and really helpful, I have found Virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the restThroughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informedFor economy class leg room was goodFood was fairly decent for aircraft foodSeamless use of boarding pass on my smart phone (first time I have done this), as well as self-serve baggage dropFlight good, cabin crew pleasant, food OK-ish, though nothing specialBack on a 777, more comfortable and quieter than 787, though still nowhere near A380 standardsCrew excellent, food unexpectedly good (the veggie lasagne was one of the best I\'ve ever had), and the wine of a good qualityOverall a good experience.It appears inflight service has improved a bit in Club and the food is now edible and availableTiming with food was greatMade time for a good restSome crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Bestthing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the B787 is - or looks - farThe odd "ying-yang" layout is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won\'t share such a narrow space with aOverall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make businessAs a regular flyer with BA, my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline anThe check-in was smooth which encouraged me that I had made the right choiceGood value if a free upgrade.It\'s under IAG and new "leadership" team that aim to cut expenses at any cost, one of them being customer serviceThis is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views, comfortable seats and reasonable food (I had a small bacon roll and a very strangeHowever, we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anywayAfter boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine, which for a change was pleasantly chilledThe staff were generally friendly, especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul tripWe landed on time in AntiguaOverall the flight was enjoyable without ever achieving any great heights (pardon the pun!) and importantly with a good cabin crew we were able to enjoy the experience.I had selected a very cheap offer to upgrade to business class and for once it was worth the extraCaptain very informative, and they are BA\'s biggest asset for the details provided to customersA hot chicken sandwich, cheese & biscuits and chocolate mousse was served - all to a good standardDrinks of your choice from the bar and decent coffee to followCabin staff were extremely friendly and efficient, probably due to being a quiet Saturday evening flight.These are words you may not read often, but I actually enjoy the British Airways flights from London CityThe staff are friendly and, for now, they still feed you and offer extra drinksBut for short-haul, BA is my first choice out of City.Compared to other airlines I\'ve used they by far in my view, deliver better service all roundStaff are polite and friendlyFood is always tastyEasy check in system at the airportEfficient and very good value for money all round.Staff were very friendly and professional on both sectorsFlights on timeSo it was a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife (we are both gold card holders) from the lounge and put us onOverall, very enjoyable flights, but not any better than some airlines\' business class.On the plus movie selection is great and TV on the A380 is good but not in Singapore Airlines leagueYour air miles earning for this route is more generous than Garuda and SingaporeI Would recommend premium economy if you can or If you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is 2-4-2 rather than 3-4-3 downstairsSo low costIn fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight BA 296 was better than the premium offer on outward legI have always given fair reviews to any airlineIt has got to the point like so many other reviews I will use the avios and move to Qatar who appreciate their loyal customersThat was probably Ryanair but they\'ve really raised their gameAircraft full but boarding and seating was well handled by the ground staffNo major complaints, toilets clean and functionalCabin crew were polite and did their jobIt turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experienceThanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seatBoarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengersThe rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy tooThe stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snackContrary to a lot of the other reviews I found the aircraft and staff on board to be fineSat in 24 d on G-VIIO seat was comfortable and big enough with a decent amount of reclineI agree the IFE is not to the standard of other airlines but it was watchable and had a fairly decent amount of content on itThe staff were all friendly, attentive and helpful so no problems thereBritish Airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinationsOther companies such as Air Canada offer a superior experience for the same priceFamiliarity definitely breeds contempt, but BA really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other productsAmazing flight without a problem, arriving on time despite a little late departureSeat confort was great for economyBack of seat was very good and leg space seemed above average..seat confort on this A380 seemed better than Emirates A380Crew was great, available and with special attention to kids.I deliberately choose Newark as it is served by a new Boeing 787Its not bad, a bit better than the Boeing 777 - but nowhere close to Singapore Airlines, Emirates etcIt is a nice set up thoughBoarded on time and had dinnerWines okThe bed was made up and I slept for a few hoursIt was okayChampagne was served and for once it was chilledWell done BA, you saved \xc2\xa310 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x \xc2\xa35 for the amuse bouche - grand saving of the operating costs asmoked salmon with Oscietra caviar, Burford egg, shallots, creme fraiche and chive cress." Oh my goodness - Caviar(Yes folks 5 eggs, not 5 grams) You had to laughThe main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeedWine okFAs all fineWe landed ahead of schedule - and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilotAll very pleasant and not busy for oncePlane fairly new and a lot better than the old crate we flew out inTook off on timeFor once I had the meal - as it looked niceIt was a salmon salad - and I have to say it was very good indeedMy wife had a hot cheese sandwich which she said was okChampagne was served from the bottle, it was niceWe landed on time and closer to the terminalNot bad for BA for once.Upper deck in Economy, great service, friendly and efficient crewit - it was very quick so no problem there.German passengers with us were amazed that all items of refreshment had to be purchasedPleasant surprise - its pretty top notchGood food and plenty of boozeNice and airy with spacious seatingAll good so farThen the flight was called and our new found love affair with BA quickly recededPlane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats)Took off on timeThe crew are nce and friendly, so no real complaints apart from on a 10.5 hour flight during the day, they were nowhere to be seen until about 1.5 hoursCheck in cheerfully doneSeats, food and entertainment good, drinks plentiful, staff attentive and friendlyReturn trip, flight crew greeted us with smiles and showed us to our seats Dinner and breakfast terrificStaff attentive and friendly all flightAll in all both flights were on clean aircraft with friendly attentive crewThank you BA, we shall be flying with you again.Food and wine were OK and crew were goodFlat bed was goodTerminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutesWe secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deckSeats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fineBA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline pricesI managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys betweenShort haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haulworthy of the nameFriendly staff on the flight and in the airport First time in Premium Economy, and we loved it Also, having just come from a cruise on a line famed for its food, the food stood up surprisingly well compared to Oceania\'s.LATAM Lounge in Buenos Aires was nice, food average but connecting from Santiago I had the time to take a shower, with ground crew extremely nice and attentiveFood was just ok (I still can\'t understand how BA can run out of entr\xc3\xa9e options in Business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly andEntertainment system made me smile a bit, as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier Economy class onesThe cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that BA have going for themWe travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experienceI like BA\xe2\x80\x99s website that allows you split classes like thisFlights left and arrived on timeAll BA cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpfulFood very good outwardIn more than 50 years of traveling, I have not been in a worse business classUnited Airlines now has a better trans-Atlantic coach product than BAEntertainment: Boeing 777-200 outbound with good, modern, on-demand IFE systemCabin crews were generally friendlyIn fairness, both our flights were on time and nothing went wrongOverall the service was very goodThe flight attendants were very attentive throughout the flight, and very professionalThe flight was full, but service did not sufferThe highlight of the meal was the two bite chocolate granacheSeat comfort was the best I\'ve experienced in economySeats was good, food all right, complimentary drinks and very welcomeThe IFE was great, the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircraft\'s for this type of long haul, but no particular issues.It employs tactics of EasyJet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service.Food is nothing special but service is politeBags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next dayWould fly again as usually have good fares to Mexico.Landed on timePassengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be servedBA is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fareThe flight left a little late but arrived almost on time, which was fineI classify this airline as slightly above a budget airline (you do get one meal after all and entertainment) but not much better than that.I have to agree with all the other reviews on heredifference! All the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaperI have flown BA in the past and have been happy with theA business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from Sofia to BostonI have to say that my wife, daughter and I were completely pleased, somewhat surprisingly soDecent contract loungeExcellent service and food onboard both the Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to BostonTerrific flight attendants, and much better food than I am used to on United, LH or AustrianAll three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best I have hadThe Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal was excellentNot as much food on offer as in the LH and OS lounges, or even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2, but it was quiet and comfortableAnd we really liked the quirky Club World business cabinThe middle section is great for couples, every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solidAn excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from Hong Kong to Copenhagen through LondonDespite being in economy class, the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive (serving our needs before we even needed to ask)They were friendly and made us feel completely at homeThe on-board entertainment selection was very extensive, with high-quality options (English and international movies of high caliber) and the screen interface was modern and easy to useThe seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seatThe pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking, and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence, arrival time, weather without being overbearing or overlyWith regards to the pre-boarding/ground service, one of the check-in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and I so that we could sit together and have aWe really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasantBritish Airways in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be.The only positive of the trip was the lounge at GatwickThe first class fight to was OK - nice cabin crew and good food, but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting - no snacks, water etc in the galley likeI\'ve always enjoyed flying British Airways and usually make my yearly trips to Philly with them rather than flying direct to Newark via UnitedThe long haul flight was OK - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was OK for an economy class flightOn the up side, the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as alwaysConsidering I got the flight for a good price, it was OKYes British Airways are investing but long overdueI always try and fly Qatar where possible when going to Asia now, as the service is better and often the price tooUpside - service on board BA559 was excellentBA hope to achieve in the long run - I can guarantee, I will seek other airlines first before considering them againAnybody contemplating going to New Orleans from Heathrow - fly with somebody else and get an internal connection - you won\'t regret itWe flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience We were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humourThe lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessertThe only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvreIf it weren\'t for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on BA who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe, we would not travel on BAWe would try to find another full service airline, because we enjoy flying.The cabin crew, bar one lazy individual, were excellentI changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any wayBA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with goodThe owners hired \xc3\x81lex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrierI do hope BA will do so in the hopefully not to distant future - and keep their great staff on ground and on board.The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone\'s payment card failed to register on theirHaving only flown easyJet / Ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, I was pleased to see a relatively low-cost BA flight for myI was also tantalised by the BA bragging of M&S supplied foodIt certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptionsThey had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriersFlight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were goodOn the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real \'pro\' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy faresLower your expectations to this level, and you\'ll probably have a pleasant flight.The flight from Heathrow to Gibraltar was uneventful, clean aircraft, no delays, no issues - apart from the lack of drinks / snacksT5 at LHR is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where things areSeat comfort was ok albeit very tight and narrowThe IFE was great and that was the highlightBA is a premium airline but looks to be offering a Ryanair standardLounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good, decent food and the plane was cleanNow this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a differenceStaff onboard were friendly, and that is allWe found the crew to be friendly and attentiveOn the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staffI know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs duringDidn\'t much care for the cereal bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that!Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BAFirst class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staffGood menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beersExcellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crewA weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cookedGood cheeses and all courses selected were availableAfter some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flightDecent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etcOn time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward legNice crew who were efficient and offered decent serviceAfternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bagsHeathrow Terminal 5 is a great airport, dedicated to British Airways, the check-in service was not as fast as they say, it was normalThe BA staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to helpChoice of movies and TV Shows are pretty good so I can\'t fault BA on thatThe seats are nice, the head rest is excellent and leg room is okayThe food is okay (Your first meal) its hot and options were good, two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a planeCabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training - polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flightsBoth flights on timeOverall just about ok for value for moneyOn board, flight early, nice breakfast, good CCCC again good on board and an ok lunchThe crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal availableI had heard all the bad reviews about them and they did not disappointFood was good, I will give them thatCheck in very fast and efficient, plane pretty much on timeFlew British Airways from Beijing - London Heathrow, Emerald member so a one minute check-in with a dedicated counter was appreciatedThe BGS Lounge which BA uses was a welcome surprise, owing to the fact that there are many Japanese food options at that time (JAL also shares the lounge)Crew were friendly enoughFree exit-row seats for friend and I (Emerald benefit).A couple of years ago I switched to BA from Lufthansa as I find London a more convenient transit airport, while both airlines offering the same high levels of serviceTrust they maintain the engines better!San Diego to London, an excellent flight with really good Club World service from crewThe crew in the upper deck knew their jobs, anticipated requirements and smiled when delivering service, no complaints and a decent nights sleepOutbound crew were helpful and energetic, keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was usedThe only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen, left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when I travelled home10/10 to British Airways staff in St Lucia for managing this so wellI hope that BA will be renewing its fleet soon, it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made.The only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move meSo we had to leave mega early so I could sit near him! Luckily got the seat behind himBreakfast was a muesli bar! I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct, however my annual flights to BarbadosFlew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of \xc2\xa31200 return for both of usThe cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runsOn the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very goodIt was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of meFinally, my Lagguage that was \'priority\' came out last.The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengersSuper views over the airfieldI have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and wasI have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job ofLocated just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch outThe inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest moviesOn the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy classAircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcomingI have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroomI fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can getSome years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggsIt read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of allVery pleasant FAsPlane on timeClub world middle seats which were a good option for usDrinks were goodFA\'s were in the main good but some better than othersI was well looked afterOverall a good flightFlight left and arrived on timeWhat made this flight so outstanding was the crewVery attentive and enthusiasticsection and served - to her pleasant surprise.Going to India this time, I decided to go east, via LHR and BA seemed a good ideaa boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flightThe flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choiceI\'m 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I\'m not fatAmerican Airlines internationals are much betterFinally, I\'m now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesliThe plane was spotless, comfortable and well presentedThe staff were impeccable, polite and helpful - in my view some of the bestOverall they continue to impress.London Heathrow to Chicago O\'Hare and my experience was wonderfulWe were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their bestMade my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spotBoarding was easy although I didn\'t use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement)I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I didOur cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for themThe food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it\'s by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft)There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more)I couldn\'t fault my trip out and I am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable.I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlinesOn the plus side Business Class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentiveBA need to do better though, far better if they are to compete with the good Middle East and Far Eastern airlines.Staff were very minimalistic in their serviceI paid \xc2\xa350 extra for an exit seat - this is the best thing to doYou get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander / stretch whenever you want, and it is good value on a ten hour flightThe meals were fineThe staff are friendly and politeBusiness class (which I sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable qualityThe only reason I continue to fly BA is because I have fairly set routes and BA generally fly at times which suit meI decided to give British Airways a chance for a short weekend trip to London, because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low-cost airlinesA plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was goodI really miss the days when British Airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and I wouldbe happy to get back to those daysSome good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule, boarding was very efficient, which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous, a lot ofspace, very comfortable leather seatsI got first time flight by British AirwaysCabin crew are professional though, so this is not their mistakeThis journey was a very pleasant surpriseI didn\'t expect great service and was not disappointedI didn\'t expect great food or wine and was not disappointedI didn\'t expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprisedThe comfort of seat on a long haul is far more important to me that anything else and this was a far more pleasant experience than I had expected.Easy check in and fast track security meant I was in the lounge within 15 minsI let the front desk know, and the staff made me a fresh sandwichThe Manager fetched some IPA from the first lounge - some really good customer service which is typical in this loungeFast service after take off with an ok entreeReturn a week later was a better flightEasy check in again and no fast track queueFast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer serviceGenerous with the drinksA loyal customer of many, many years, I will choose their competitors in future.London Heathrow to Las Vegas, and a great journeyThe flight was on time and staff were professional and friendlyThe inflight meals were tasty and the portions of a good sizeAlthough the seats are a bit narrow, they were comfortable and the leg room was adequateFacilities on the plane were cleanWould definitely fly BA again.I live near Manchester Airport and KLM/Air France and Lufthansa are more attractive options.The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinksand a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficientThe British Airways flight itself was okay, the crew friendly and the cabin worked fineThey put passengers first!I was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional roomOn the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do wellFood and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy classBoarding at YVR was very well organised, less so at the Heathrow endOverall a reasonable experience, but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish.Attendants said it was the quietest they had every seenFood and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years oldPlenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I\'d flown onI was given an exit row seat which was very welcomeThe flight is good as I booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying BA to get this best seat 16K, other seats are below standard forService is good and food is adequateI fly this route many times on BA rather than CX: CX is better but BA better priced, and that is, if you get the best seatgood that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the Cathay Pacific lounge as this caters for long haul passengersdeplane and coach connection, but good that business passengers are taken away first in a separate carThe flight is OK with snack and drink.Online check in was quick and easy, and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for checkThat was the only good part of our journeyOur inbound flight was on a newer A319 which had better seats and a skymapI am happy to have chosen BA, in the airport, at the gate, in the plane, I felt safe and people listen to meI had the chance the two times (going and back) to meet the captain in the cockpit to feel betterThe crew was nice and friendly and thanks to them I had a comfortable flight and I am now ready to Take it againThe planes were clean and niceLuckily we were able to swap with another passenger once on boardHowever, service provided by cabin crew was excellentThe sole advantage is that they fly to/from major airportsNo, I want it nowOther airlines namely Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, even American, in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money, you even still get snacks on long haul flights!(I guess all the airlines are doing it right?).\r\n\r\nService is equal to Ryanair and EasyJetI said great book thatShe managed to get me a flight to Philadelphia the next dayI begged and pleaded (and cried) and they somehow by the grace of a higher being found a seatLufthansa, for example, treated me so well and I wasn\'t even a paying customer.I have been a loyal customer of British Airways for 30 yearsThe new BA CEO is doing a great job of turning a once great airline into their low cost subsidiary Vueling.be grateful for the food I was getting\'I hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon." My response was that \'I don\'t think so\'.The Boeing 777 outbound was a bit scruffy but overall a good experienceCrew excellent on all flightsI continue to favor BA for long trips - they really work hardI like the upper deck cabin and at my preferred seat, with complete privacyDrinks are served generouslyHas good arrival lounge at LHR, a necessity as flight arrives at 4:50am.I was surprised with the standards of Aegean Airlines, so pleasant staff, clean aircraft, the comfort of the seat and quality of the foodA good flightGatwick to Salzburg return in business class, and these were pleasant flights, with both flights arriving earlyThe flight out was early morning, so a hot breakfast was provided with champagneTo my surprise the cabin looks very nice (although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of Ryanair) and has a pleasant feelingwere then great! But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same routeBoth legs on the A380 which is a super plane, spacious, comfortable and cleanEntertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older 747\'sBoth flights were very good with attentive, friendly cabin crew and excellent foodEven SAS offer a complimentary coffeeVery friendly and efficient cabin crewGood choice of drinks and soft drinksInformative cockpit crewOverall I am impressedDecent value for the money paidI would definitely fly with BA again.Business check-in was better but still very busyTook a shower whilst waiting and that was OKnice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked afterairlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don\'t have to climb over another person to get out whilst theyI spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly homeI saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and whooffer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wantedNever thought I\'d say this but I\'ve joined the ABBA club, anybody but BA.Absolutely fine from online check in, baggage drop at Gatwick to collecting baggage in MauritiusPleasant and courteous staff member at baggage dropBoarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothlyBoeing 777 about 16 years old, but still in presentable conditiontall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12-hour flight in economy - at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightlyNot the largest seat screen I\'ve experienced but fine, and there was a reasonable selection of movies, tv and musicCabin crew friendly and efficient service, with water service through the night, plus option to get drinks from the galleyLanded on timeWe got there safely, on time and in reasonable comfortNo to worry though, British Airways will feed me onboardGiven that BA use the smallest glasses possible, coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade, you will be thirstyComfortable flights and first-rate cabin service both waysis my favourite ale, Old Speckled Hen, not previously seen by me on an airline (I paid with Avios)BA is still my first choice for international travel and get me to/from my destination in comfort and with attentive, friendly service.The service was great and flight attendants would pass by regularly with refreshments.American Airlines are now better than British Airways and that says it all.Flight good, staff attentivethere were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food butBoarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crewFlight crew gave good informationVery good experience both flightsMature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service, very energetic younger crew on return, where everything happened quickly and efficientlyBoth crews friendly and had control of the cabin, which made for a relaxed atmosphereFood noticeably better than of late - I hope this will continueConcorde Room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed, but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very muchAll in all good solid enjoyable flightsUp to two years ago one felt good when travelling BAThey were miles ahead of budget airlinesYes they were a bit more expensive, but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage, checked in cases of 20kg, all part of the serviceHowever, I wasn\'t very fussy about this as I was very excited to be getting marriedThe good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabinIt was better than my last trip in Club World, but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around Asia (not with BA), one quickly realises howIFE was okaySFO-LHR BA286 19th January was a full Business Class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendantsPerfect mix of professionalism, friendliness and efficiency although the Boeing 747 had seen better daysThey had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleepPost take off drinks were served relatively quicklyBeing a Gold card holder the CSM (who was a delight) came to give me her \'personal welcome\' and I did feedback about my experienceWhat a great little airlineAgain very young crew but an absolute delightThe service was really good even for this short flightThe crew were smiley, the food offered was okay (before BA discontinued free food and drinks in 2017), and the flight departed on timeLondon Heathrow T5 was good and the queues weren\'t too long, even though it was peak Summer time.The crew on that flight was very goodI had a middle seat, 7E, but it turned out fine, but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business classThe food quality was better than some airlines.I will stick with Emirates or Virgin in the future as I know the aircraft are clean with good customer serviceCrew was very friendly and helpfulBritish Airways is a very good airlineThey did me big favour and booked next available flight (next day) free of chargeVery impressed.Seats 62J/K on upper deck excellent for a couple, although the plane was looking its age, with patching up wherever you lookedCabin crew friendly enoughArrived ahead of scheduleInitial impressions were positiveThe check-in was efficient with polite and friendly staffThe Concorde Room was a nice place to beMy First suite (2A) offered a good amount of comfort, space and privacyThe 1st cabin crew member was polite and professionalThe \xe2\x80\x98You First\xe2\x80\x99 department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email10,000 Avios points was because British Airways \xe2\x80\x9chave to be consistent so we\xe2\x80\x99re fair to all our customers\xe2\x80\x9dWell, that was the case until 5 minutes before 10.22!

Both flights on time and the meal was average.Thank you for the complimentary micro-bag of crisps on the delayed LHR-MAN leg! If I never see BA/AA ever again it\'ll be too soon.\r\nHopefully his accommodations were better than mineThe flight attendants on BA have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin, the point was to sleep.Other airlines are far superiorOutbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from World Traveller Plus (worth the money for a decent night\'s sleep)Fast check in and fast track security at Pearson meant I was in the lounge within 15 minsExcellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soupThe lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked barA glass of champagne, with a top up, before departureA well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually availableThe return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure(clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a BA Silver member)The flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old BA I knew and lovedFast bar service done by tray and not by cart, an excellent meal of roast chicken, with a delicious caramel desert (plated too) and some decent winesThat said, the wines were very goodThe cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when askedAn early landing, and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back homeIf only BA could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout, then there is a chance BAcould return to it\'s former gloryand half a tumbler of water, to later serve quite a tasty lunch with just coffee or tea ? Pokey TV screen but okay IFE programme choiceAt least with Ryanair you know what to expectA blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably goodso tired, however outbound and inbound I found the seats to be decentInflight entertainment was quite good too (did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phones however)I was looking forward to a nice breakfast before landing back at Gatwick from Mexicoour First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on their B747-400, I needn\'t have worried, this flight was excellent on all aspectsLuckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems, passengers with tight connections at LHR were offered alternative connection optionsThe Concorde Lounge in LHR T5 BA First Class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff, we had booked a Cabana and Spa Treatments, both were superb and highlyrecommended, plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the fullThe lounge offers A la Carte Dining and the food was excellentpromptly, Champagne and great wines were also availableOnboard the BA747 in the First Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight, the seats were made into a bed bythe cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours sleep, good quality quilts and pillows helped thisSeats 1A or 1K may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than 2A 2K, but this is not a negative issueThe meal service was excellent, dine when you want, excellent choice of aperitifs, wines and champagneThe young Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flightBA First is in a league of it\'s own and miles ahead of Club, both in the Air and on the Ground! Well done BA, this really was a FirstClass experience in every meaning of the words.I thanked him and leftThe A380 is a state of the art flying machineFood was very tasty and vastCabin crew were friendly and kind, the flight departed and arrived on time to London, very nice British Airways.\r\n\r\nWe boarded and fortunately were away only two and a half hours lateI would like our appreciation to be passed on to the Captain and crew that day.This was a much better flight than our outward LHR-BKK with British AirwaysThe staff were on the ball, worked hard and always aroundA nice plane, good IFE with wide modern screenI got a decent sleep.The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transitwas more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on throughI live in London and I\'m a loyal American Airlines frequent flyer clocking around 200,000 miles a yeara mere \xc2\xa312.50 to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner for each child - in London, good luck)Food was good as was the service with very friendly cabin crewFlights left on timegood food on offerDeparted on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late, service okay again with a snack and drink offeredOkay experience I use BA domestically and in business clas around Europe because Heathrow is convenient to where I live and to sustain my Executive Club (Oneworld) status, however thereHowever this year I\'ve realised there are far cheaper and far better options for long haul within the oneworld alliance.Food was quite tasty but small portion, no side saladCSL was fab and another male attendant working the first cabin of world traveler on the main deck when I could not sleep and went to the galley to chatLack of snack choices which was poor, how many lemon cookies can you eat? Got to love that they do multiple rounds of drink service as Singapore Airlines never hasAlmost all other airlines will have same or better leg room, definitely better meals and cost a lot less, so don\'t choose British Airways unless you are getting a goodGround staff at DFW were OK though there was no agent in the lounge till about 3 hours before departurePlane is new with great windowsFlight crew was fine, meal service was adequate, wines were good, in-flight kitchen has been cut back to almost nothingHaving chosen the \'best seat\' (this is important), I had a good flight onboard the A380 Upper deckIf on A380 with my chosen seat, this may be my preferred flight between LHR and HKGEventually, after asking several helpful members of airport staff, I retrieved my luggage from Terminal 2Quite enjoyable flights both ways with first-rate leg-room (38in in WTP vs 31in in regular WT remains a strong positive point with me), some of the best airline cuisine I\'vehad in recent years, an excellent pre-meal drinks service including Tribute Cornish ale, on-time departure/arrival and the attentive, courteous cabin-crew service I\'ve received through the years from British Airways(Two tiny flyspecks though - no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service, but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip.) This remains my favouriteyears though), but on this and other recent showings BA\'s World Traveller Plus premium economy remains as good as ever.\r\n\r\nBoarding and departure both efficientA few empty seats in the separate cabin so that contributed to a relaxed flightFood acceptable - justManchester to Heathrow, similar to the flight up with efficient boarding and impressive that a trolley service is squeezed inOtherwise this is a great little short hop.Done this flight a number of times and kudos to the fact they manage to get a trolley service in before landingPlane was half full as it was Thanksgiving Day so that made for a nice relaxed flightNo real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desiredGlad this ticket was on milesOther 5 flights meals were just okayIFE was average with dated movies but found enough to keep amusedBritish Airways crew going out from London Heathrow to Calgary were very keen and enthusiasticThey were also very good fun, which makes life more pleasant up in the skyThe staff were very efficient and we felt safe, and there were regular drinks runs, but like many others who travel regularly with BA, we were a little disappointed, andhope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years.Thai Airways or Eva Air for the same price offer a much better service (for direct flights)If you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you \'Can you wait? service is in 20 mins\' this has been tested a few timesI have had better economy experiences than this sectorFood also shows reals signs of cost reduction, and BA is very much closer to low-cost carriers than airlines like Lufthansa or SwissPleasantly surprised to have experienced a nice flight on BAAlthough the aircraft was relatively old, the seats were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitchCabin crew were extremely friendly and attentiveThey showed compassion and were professional in their servicesA really good flight, left on time, crew smiled and looked like they were having funA full cooked British breakfast which was served with great efficiency and was hotInteractions with passengers positiveOn both flights the crews paid extra attention to children and I liked how they delivered child lifejackets to the bins above kids for each child passengerNo complaints at allFood actually quite decent for once, and crew on top of their game both directionsClean comfy seatsHaving not flown British Airways long haul for over fifteen years I was pleasantly surprised on my recent return trip to LondonThe premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was well above averageHowever, more important was the unobtrusive service provided by the cabin staff whereby announcements are kept to a minimum and there is no constant patrolling during the flightBoth flights left and arrived on timeOverall a very good experience.However the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagneThe cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this was brilliantThe flightdeck kept us updated during the flightBA was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and foodthey do not run out of the food selection on the menuAsking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaningOverall crew on this flight was extremly friendlyNext leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still oldCrew on board once again very friendly and effectiveMeal choice was okLondon to Singapore in first class was British Airways at its bestThe Concorde Lounge was well staffed and the food and wine was exquisiteI was welcomed to the First Class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crewThere was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagneThroughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly, helpful and interested as well as anticipating what I neededThe food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped upThe aircraft arrived on time and we left with a minimum of fussThe cabin was clean, the seats seemed new and the toilets, although small, were kept spotlessI could not fault anything before and during this flight.Check in at T5 quick and easy I was able to use fast track and the North Executive lounge through my FF status, boarding through gate A7 onto a cleanUsed the Executive lounge which is okay with a supply of snacks and drinks, it\'s also adjacent to the gate used by BA is pretty handyDeparted on time, seat 16B on another clean A320, crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flightGood service, I guess the only option not cheap, but would use again even if I had a choice.we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade, better choice of meals anda good service for the price they have paid.Good Terminal 5 ground serviceReasonable former bmi A321 with AVOD entertainment which was nicegood value and my rating is really based on the "value" rather than experience.Having recently flown on Oman Air, Virgin Atlantic and Turkish Airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantasticEntertainment betterThe First Class lounge experience was very business class at the mostSofia to London Heathrow, and the flight was on timeI have flown budget airlines that offer better leg roomOnce in the plane fast exit from Heathrow and once on flight a bag of chips, or peanuts, very healthyHaving flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380The standards have dropped so far it is incredibleNice flightFast boarding, full flight but left Lisbon on time and got to London with no delaysFood on flight was nice for such a cheap flightNot like my return trip but British Airways makes us feel special when the service is ok.The general ambiance is quite goodAll goodFood was OKThe meze was fineBrilliantWow, a \xc2\xa33 saving on a \xc2\xa33,00o one way ticketWell done BAWatched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fineNodded off and had two hour nap which was niceI found the experience to be very positive indeedThe check-in agent was very friendly and professional and made a very positive first impressionThe gate staff were friendly and polite and boarding was quick and efficientDuring this short flight the captain was informative and the cabin crew did a sterling job at serving drinks and snacks on a relatively short flightDisembarkation was orderly and my bag arrived in good time tooI am a very happy customer and will use this route again in the future.\r\n\r\nThis particular Boeing 747 had clearly had its day, but was infinitely better than my return flight on the A380Negatives over and everything else was superb! The overall ambience isn\'t flash but rather understated elegance which you have to be British to fully understand I supposeThe champagne, fine wines and cognac complimented the restaurant quality a la carte meal and the service was second to none from our geordie stewardWe loved the fact that one of our cabins could be set as a table for 2.Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter durationConcorde lounge at LHR niceWas excited to try the Boeing 787 and new first on this special occasion tripLook good with nice finishing touches of leather and chrome, but seats quite narrowBreakfast okTable for dinner wouldn\'t extend properly and reading light fell out of its socket - on a new aircraft? We had a lovely flight all in redeeming Avios for occasionIt therefore came as a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changedThe stewardesses were very friendly and attentiveThe aircraft was a Boeing 787 with a seat configuration of 3+3+3 which was goodIn-flight entertainment was very good and it workedBoarding at Seoul Incheon airport was surprisingly quickAll in all a very good experience.I hadn\'t flown British Airways in a while but I thought I\'d give them a go againLet me begin by saying that BA crews are tremendousThey are friendly, approachable, professional, amiable and affableThe flight deck did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcementsThe service on board was very good, the food was plentiful and quite tastyThe inflight entertainment was excellentLoads of choices and great qualityAll in all a great experienceBased on that, I will keep flying BA for my transatlantic flightsAgain, the crews are a credit to BA, they do a great a job.Seat on the Boeing 747 not the most comfortable, but still a slightly bit better than on Air Canada\'s 10 across Boeing 777-300ERMeal served after takeoff was chicken with rice - it was fairly tastefulI was pleasantly surprised by the experience, first time for premium economy with this particular airlineThe seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficientThe flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on the flightBritish Airways was the cheapest airline when I booked this flight from Edinburgh to Gatwick, cheaper than EasyjetGreat service, ok snack foodProfessional all roundPlane was on time and no issuesBest value flight from a great little airport.Flight ok with warm food (chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes - also with mushroom!) and enough champagne to make one feel sleepyExcellent and friendly cabin crew.However the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flightWhen I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experienceIt was fineVery busy - but the light lunch was better than BA\'s own set up - the last time we used itI settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fineOn both flights I got the front row which gave more legroomFAs in both directions were splendidI had a perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways to Boston and back this month (Oct 2016)Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it\'s a bonus if you get some ex Concorde crewAll in all, I use BA because from the UK I can get to any part of the world quickly with few changes and in safety.Marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journeyA 2 year old A380, the seats were much nicer than the 777-200 outbound flight - seat 82a, I did like the extra storage bin to the side of theThat\'s the positives out of the wayFirst time flying with British Airways and will most certainly be my lastWe could have opted to go with Virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with BAThe crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a very pleasant experience from the passengers (and the crew might I add!)The only great part of the trip was the first class lounge in Kuala Lumpur, thanks to Malaysia Airlines as it is their lounge and NOT British Airways The one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time, and arrived 10 minutes earlyWas excited to fly First Class on BA from Dulles to Nairobi, since it\'s about 15 hours of flying time I decided to splurge on a 1st Class ticketGreat meal and service thereWell I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was wellAs a flag carrier, what message does this send to the rest of the world? On a positive note, the cabin crew are always polite (sometimes to the point ofGet some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortableOn a positive note: 1) I believe BA is a safe airline and the crew professionalBig bonus point for me2) When there is a problem, BA is efficient in sorting it out3) Communication from the cockpit is usually good.The plane was clearly dated - judging by the old IFE screens and even some rust here and there - but the plane was clean, the crew were extremely niceThe food was good, although I would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantialOverall, it was a nice flightI believe communication to be important and appreciate the gestureThe crew were extremely nice and the snack we were given was just fine for such a short flightThe cabin crew was efficient and friendly, and the AVOD was excellent, much improved from the older 747\'s, which we have had on the routeThe online check-in was fast and easyI asked the staff, and at least they found my hand luggageBeverages and seat comfort in total okay.Singapore Airlines is in a league way way aheadI should add that the lounges in Paris and London were greatParis was a share with Cathay, and London\'s Terminal 5 lounge was excellentThe was our first experience on BA\'s A380 and it was very comfortable and relaxingThe boarding at Singapore was efficient friendly and on timeWe made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the bedsNever the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrowThe staff were very professional and did not bother us until breakfast timeBreakfast was just ok with limited options but this was ok for usThe A380 is clearly the benchmark in long haul First Class flight and on this occasion BA provided a high quality service.Our preferred airline is Etihad but we decided to try BA as we secured a very competitive First fareWe were delighted with the service from Qantas (BA flys out of SYD) in Melbourne in booking our bags through to SingaporeThe boarding in SYD was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crewDeparture (1500) was on time and the 9 hour flight up to Singapore was very smoothCabin staff were very helpful and attentiveThe food was lovely as was the choice of wine and drinksIn summary, we were delighted with the service and flight.Was so excited when British Airways announced the new San Jose service earlier this yearSo was relieved to book out of SJC, a ten minute drive from homeWas provided an $800 compensation credit card to fly the following day which I gladly acceptedThe Boeing 787 is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this routeOverall a good trip.Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in areaThe seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortableThe quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decentThe food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was goodThe only positive thing I must mention is that employees on the plane were very gentle, polite and nice to talk to but other than that, everything else with BritishStaff were polite and efficient and we landed ahead of timeOverall a comfortable flight.Plane was clean and crew efficientEvening meal of chicken and rice was passableDeparted and landed on time - I was actually en route to Botswana so time to connect with that flightrest was OKLanded on timeThank you BA for the great adviceAircraft on remote stand at Gatwick North Terminal requiring a shuttle transfer and boarding via steps without cover - not bad this early am as just overcast but dark andCrew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciatedBoarding organised on to a pretty old 767 however seat 5A clean and comfortable, departed a little late but caught up the time with on time arrivalCrew very good, friendly and chatty, one of BA\'s assets, food served was also nice lots of drink runs on the 3hr 45min flightBoarding through gate 209 organised seat 3A old but clean and comfortable 767, departed about 1 hour late good food & service from a nice crew, arriving LHR on timeGood serviceWill continue to use British Airways if the price is right.Meal service was alright, food good, and the service also okay but they chatted in the galley most of the flight and didn\'t serve drinksThey were quite a cheerful bunch at leastCheck in process was smooth all in all.- save yourself some money because United Airlines Economy Class is better than what I experienced on this flight.Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg roomThe meal service on this leg really did make me giggleI actually had to ask if that was it? He replied "yes" to which I replied "so who\'s eaten all the food?" He laughed and actually said we were lucky,If anyone is thinking of going to Krakow with BA my advice is save your money and fly economy (with another airline), and spend the saving having fun there(I will only use Avios to get First long haul as that gets you the best return on them.I had connected from MIA to BOG with Avianca - they are a much better airlineSeats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality, and they had USB charging in economyMoreover, when I asked for a warm tea, as well as a can of coke on board, the flight attendant looked like he was doing me a favour for givingYet when I looked yesterday at the option of paying \xc2\xa315 for a seat reservation before online check-in opens, there was a good choice availableFinally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agentCheck in reasonably quick although only one desk at business class check inNew fast track security was quickNumber One lounge was busy but we had a reasonable choice of seats, refreshments OKHot breakfast was OKCabin crew were very goodAs BA Executive Club Gold member I had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type, 51D on upper deck at time of buying the ticketI am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possiblefrom odor and noise, uneventful, the cabin crew very pleasant.Lounge with a nice view, but it might have a little larger drink and food selectionThey served their afternoon tea with sandwich and scones which was deliciousBoarding for both flights was fine and hassle freeService on the VIE-LGW leg was rather lacklustre for BA, but cabin crew was professional and the flight deck - as per usual for BA - greatMuch better FA\xe2\x80\x99s on the LGW-OPO leg and again flight deck excellentHowever, the hot item of the day tends to be of good qualityWonderful service and hospitalityThe cabin was clean, the seats were comfortable and offered enough legroomThe complimentary sandwich and drink was tasty, and cabin crew friendly and helpful.Cabin crew excellentCheerful and helpfulFood and drink goodFlight left late but arrived almost on timeI wanted to fly BA\'s Boeing 787 to ShanghaiThe ground handling at Terminal 5 was very efficientThe plane was spotless, food was excellentThe best thing was the crew -  smiling and helpful, and professional Overall the high standards of the crew would be my reason to prefer BA over the competitors.Check-in very easy via AppFull flight departed gate A19 on timeCabin very smart with new seatingService was very good with a hot breakfast which was very tasty.The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerfulThe departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seatThe cabin crew were very professionalThe departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was servedMy seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followedWhen things go well, BA is excellentI give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabin-crew though.Pros: Flight on time Comfortable seats, generous luggage allowancePleasant flightI expected seats to be built-in with TVs so that kids could be busy and entertainedThankfully kids had their tablets with themStaff - Okay, but could be bit more friendly and approachableA smile would make the differenceOverall a 3 star airline in my opinion.\r\nI did find the service to be goodOn the plus side, cabin service very well trained and attentiveThe Boeing 787 is awesomeClean, spacious and excellent technology/media optionsAlso every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 1-4 hours late (a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it!)I fly with 5 family members every year to Italy - this time we are using KLM or Lufthansa - and another bonus us we can avoid Heathrow terminal 5.This flight took off and landed on timefinally off the ground, the onboard entertainment was great and the flight was quite smoothWe will be flying Premium Economy so will expect to have far fewer complaintsStandard economy class service, nothing to write home about, but efficientOne cabin crew member, an older lady was superb and I saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 Japanese people with limited EnglishThis member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airlineThe captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop-down screen to show the route of the flightTo be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrongOnce on board I found the cabin to be very cleanUnlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraftThe IFE system provided is excellentThis option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and qualityThe service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently wellArrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutesProcessing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficientHowever the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleepPleasant flight, not as comfortable as the plane flying out in July, but still nicer than the old plane I\'m used to flying into San DiegoThe crew were kind and unobtrusiveOverall, good flight.BA Club World (Business Class) is a great way to travelOn boarding it was nice to be "welcomed back", a small but nice touchStraight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks, warm towels and our menu choicesBA does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantasticOne of the things I really love about BA is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crewSuperb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selectionAs an aviation enthusiast, a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flightBA! My airline of choiceSeats were fairly comfortable with a fairly narrow seat pitch, and the entertainment selection was fairly goodThe chicken main meal was pretty good but would have preferred dinner to be served 1 hour and not 2 hours into the flightReturn flight to Singapore (BA16) was a notch better - boarding in Sydney was done in a more efficient mannerCabin crew did do two rounds of drinks service on this flight and were more attentiveGood sandwich for the snack/dinner service before arrivalStill good to note they provide toothbrushes even during day flightsVery satisfied with this BA flight and service, especially when their full service competitors charge around 40% more on Sydney flights and budget challengers aren\'t up to the mark withAvios tickets for me and my wifeGreat cabin crew on both sectors, particularly the first as it was a day time flight so we gave them more to do and had more interactionFood was pretty uninspiring and the wine list limited, but we did manage to find things that kept us pretty happyLie flat bed is comfortable, flights on time and bags delievered to the carousel fairly quickly.The Admiral lounge at MIA was reasonableThe flight left late and staff provided reasonable cabin serviceSlept well on flat bedBreakfast was OKDoha to Paris CDG via Bahrain and London, premium economy is really goodYes it also stops over in Bahrain and it\'s not direct to Paris but it was well worth itBigger seat, great food and better IFE than QatarTAM lounge at Guarulhos T3 is one of my favouritesBA First Service is fabulous, each passenger was welcomed and spoken to individually by the flight manager which I thought was a nice touchVery good wine / champagne selectionFlight left on timeA380 Club world layout was roomyFood quality was goodSeat comfortable and slept well when used as a bedOverall, a reasonable flightA superior product compared to North American carriersThe first flight to LHR was on an A320, basic economy seats for a 3.5 hour flight not great, but the meal was excellent and crew efficientBA lounge at T5 is large and busy, with plenty of quiet areas to relaxAmenities there are fine and in line with most good airport loungesBoeing 787-9 to KUL so everything new, excellent food and serviceUnlike some reviews, I am a fan of the business seat layout and go for the window seats which provide excellent privacy - once the divider is raised!.I always used to look forward to the big seats, a boozy afternoon watching movies and being treated a little bit specialFor better value and added smiles I\'ve found the premium economy offering must better value for money.He even said he was doing me a favour by booking another flight.The seat was the new First with upgraded Panasonic entertainment system, I was addressed by name throughout the flight, given extra food to try as it was a half fullcabin, regular top ups for drinks, and received a stellar service from a dedicated and professional crewThe new entertainment system was great and the buy for you fly service worked as my items were delivered to my seatOne of the best flights I\'ve had for a long time, but I always believe it\'s down to the service.Fortunately they now have a 747 on the LHR to DEN service where we can fly First Class which we are using, but it would only take another airline toNo better than economy with centre seat emptyThe only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crewMany lessons can be learned from their no frills competitors.Flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early which is always a pleasant surpriseThe seats in first may not be quite as impressive as other airlines but they are still very comfortable and spaciousInflight entertainment was very good with an excellent selection of moviesTwo areas stood out on this flight - the first was the exceptional cabin crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearingMost importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant oneThe next one (and I cannot believe I am saying this) was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in CW andIt might have been a fluke but having just flown back in Business from St Lucia, the service and food was just as goodPerhaps BA are finally listening to their customers!However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyableThe food offered in the CE cabin was deliciousBritish Airways flight from Baltimore to Heathrow was goodBritish Airways Lounge in T3 was very busy as shared with AA and others but good selection of nibbles and beers/spirits and more important to me it was clean andThe outward bound flight was uneventful (great) and as smooth a trip as I\'ve ever hadThe crew both ways were superb and professionalThe business cabin is pretty basic compared to the Middle East carriers but you can get some good sleepFood was very goodLounge in Vancouver was very nice and staff bright and cheeryAll in All great flights.The one consolation was the pilot coming out of the cockpit to apologise about the delay and offered the opportunity for passengers to view the inside of the cockpitOur flight from LAX to Rome was on time and generally goodSeats were fairly comfortableSnack on board was small but tastyFood was pretty goodOn board entertainment was goodThe flights themselves were very good, but if they want to encourage two Gold card holders to use other airlines, they are going the right way about it.Standard of food was very good with lovely wineSeat comfort and leg room okayThe week before we flew, we paid the \xc2\xa348 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat togetherWe flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BA\xe2\x80\x99s new 787 to Newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and cleanI had plenty of leg room (ok, I am 5\xe2\x80\x995) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (heThe food was ok, it was hot and tasted goodSo, three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holidayAs we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyoneAs there was a wall behind us, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enoughLuckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn\xe2\x80\x99t really recline theirs too farThe seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, I felt I had plenty of roomThe landing was smooth and we arrived on time \xe2\x80\x93 I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don\xe2\x80\x99t the airlines have that little trick of appearingAll the pods looked very tightly packed together.Cabin crew helpful and cheerfulSnack and drinks provided; quite adequate for this short flightSeats reasonably comforatable and more legroom than most budget airlinesNow that BA prices are competitive with many budget airlines this additional leg room becomes importantOverall a pleasant flight.For this reason I am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not andAfter some days I got a reply saying: \'Would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? We\xe2\x80\x99ll be more than happy to see if you\xe2\x80\x99re eligibleExcellent flightLeft more or less on time and even with the interminable taxing at JFK we still arrived on time at London GatwickStaff were friendly but professional and the B777 was clean and in excellent conditionCouldn\'t ask for moreThis was my return flight but the outward flight was just as goodI only booked a week before I flew and the price was very goodDecent offering of entertainment considering this was economy classAfter some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mumIn the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and Igood luck to them.Seat in the exit row comfortable service polite with a snack servedVery good flight back to London from BarbadosBridgetown, Barbados is a small airport but the ground staff are very friendly and efficient and the Exec lounge is good with reasonable snacks given the time of day (mid-lateafternoon) and a decent selection of drinks availableEntertainment system was excellent with a good choice of movies and very clear screen, no doubt part of the overall attention the cabin seemed to have been givenBar service was good and the food was tasty, good portion sizes, the cheesecake for dessert was \'almost\' too muchBreakfast was goodCabin crew were excellent, friendly and efficientCockpit crew were clear and concise with their comms at the start and end of the tripPrevious flights I have taken from LGW have shown a noticable difference in the cabin interiors compared to flights form LHR so it was good to see the LGW fleetgetting some needed enhancements.Very pleased to say that overall the experience was excellent, the Premium Economy product on this aircraft is fantasticSeat pitch, entertainment unit, overall comfort was goodThe crew were ok, did their job and that was itLove the A380 layout with Premium Economy on the upperdeck.Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later onPlus were excellent service, good selection of IFE and comfortable enough seats (a larger pillow would do), although I hate having to climb over someone to get out of myBritish Airways revamped Iberia after they merged but now Iberia has a much better business class product.Check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00Most comfortable seats I\'ve been inVery ergonomicPlane was cleanClear screen and nice selection of music, TV shows and recent moviesEasy to navigateI also enjoyed the multiple views of the flight from the overhead map to the mock pilot screenAttendants were very polite and dinner was served quicklyFood was as good as I\'ve had on Air France flightsI will definitely try to book with them for future trips.For the last few years travelling to Inverness from Geneva we have been using Easyjet via Gatwick so I thought it would be interesting to see how BA compares toHaving tried both airlines several times I am definitely going to side with BA on this oneFirstly, BA offer some really competitive prices on this routeSecondly, out of LHR, BA really does have the best terminalSpacious, light and with good dining optionsAs for the aircraft, well it\'s a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the A380 or the retro classic that is the B747I\'ll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it\'s ageAs an economy passenger I have found the product on British Airways to be perfectly reasonableWith Emirates you have a huge IFE, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitchHopefully the GoGo 2KU product BA is installing from 2017 will be more robustAs an economy passenger I\'m not expecting much but on the last few flights with BA I have been pleasantly surprisedThe food has not only been edible but also really quite tastyIt\'s just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the Emirates economy offeringbrings out the best in themThe recent newspaper deal with the Murdoch empire is a nice touchTerminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epicHowever, the new concourse D for departures is really niceOverall, a pleasant flightI would happily fly with BA again.The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable, and the cabin crew were friendly and attentiveMy meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fianc\xc3\xa9e had no complaints either with her pasta dishOverall, aside from the small IFE issues, a thoroughly pleasant flight.British Airways has always been one of my favourite airlinesComfort on the A321 was very good, stylish leather seats with adjustable headrestsOn all flights I found the crew professional, friendly but somewhat reservedI found the quality and quantity of catering very good.Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new ticketsWe were treated incredibly well and staff made our trip as memorable as possibleHaving found out we heading off on our honeymoon the champagne flowed and they looked after us so wellIn particular an Irish FA was amazing to us and I\'d like to thank him and the staff on the flightWe will recommend British Airways to friends and family and this trip would make me choose BA for future flights.I proceed to JFK and at check in they kindly moved me to an earlier flight (BA172)Check in was easy and smoothI was greeted by friendly crew once onboardLegroom was decent though, and because the flight is empty I had plenty of space to stretch outService was done in a very discreet wayWe arrived at Heathrow early despite the late departure in JFKT5 was a pleasant airport to arriveSpacious and airy, and there was no queue in immigrationChecked in at Heathrow T5 was smooth and quickT5 is pleasant enoughThe flight left Heathrow late as usual but the captain assured us that we would make up the time and should arrive earlyHowever the seat itself was ok as it has plenty of leg room and is comfortable, although I am not a big fan of the ying-yang designThe service onboard was  very friendly and informalI felt that service has been consistent and is the biggest asset of the airlineFlight left on time and arrived on timeOn both lags of the journey the service was efficient and professionalFlight left on time and arrived at Gatwick slightly ahead of scheduleBreakfast included a bacon roll which was niceFlatbed reasonable comfortable and we got a few hours sleep.Seat configuration may be a bit odd but suited us for a day time flight and made conversation easy, although the window seat could be a bit claustrophobic with theFood and drinks were very good, we both had chosen the fillet steak for the main course and although cooked a bit longer than we would prefer was still moistand tastyWine and Champagne selection very goodThe only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but that\'s where it stopsMid flight snack okmy Android Phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely, apologizing to us, offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would beDesert was a chocolate mousse which was lovelyAfternoon tea was two sandwiches and a scone with cream which was quite niceGood supply of water/drinks throughout the flight and the FA was goodNot a bad flight and I would use BA again in the future.Thanks to BA charging \xc2\xa330 to check in luggage one way, every passenger takes cabin baggageStaff were very polite and helped as much as they couldGood service from FAs, and a high quality screen for IFEI\'ve traveled with British Airways many times, and always thought it was a decent airline and preferred it for my trips back to Philadelphia over some of the other airlinesThe customer service woman did her best for us and gave us new tickets but for a much later flight, and advised us write you in order to "follow itI was looking forward to trying the new 787 from British Airways flying from Kuala Lumpur to LondonThe positives were that staff were friendly and courteous under difficult circumstances and they didn\'t bother forcing us to endure the safety walk throughProvided you eat before you fly, restrict your water intake, wrap up very warm and take your own tablet/ereader then it will be fineService was very fastI\'ve reviewed British Airways poorly in the past but was very pleasantly surprised with this flightI have only complimentsEven with a full plane, check in was fine and well organised boarding, plus the flight was on timeThe food was very good (really!), except the tateless cardboard wrap just before landing, and there were multiple drinks runs thoughout the flightAn adequate if small movie selection, service with a smileBest economy class flight I\'ve had for yearsIt\'s great to see that BA can still do it very well and provide such an experienceAfter a very nice first flight from Tampa to Chicago with my wife and our 15 months old baby, transit in Chicago was really smoothWe found a quiet "dinner part" of the business lounge, were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relaxFood was decentBoarding the upper deck of this Boeing 747-400 was a pleasure with a CSD welcoming us by nameFlight was excellent: food amazing, enough cold drinks were offered, cabin crew looking after us and our babyAfter this perfect flight, transit in LHR terminal was again relaxingStroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very niceLast flight to Amsterdam was in a full cabin, nice and frriendly cabin crewRome to London Heathrow with British Airways, and the flight itself was efficient and on-timeComfortable seat, nice entertainmentThe food served was adequate at bestI have been a loyal customer of BA for over 50 yearsI had high expectations of the A380 flight with new aircraftThe British Airways First Class experience was fantasticThe staff all certainly demonstrated their commitment to the BA slogan "To fly to Serve"Each course was tasty and well presentedAll food and beverages served were of a very high standard and qualityThe seat was roomy and very comfortableThe fully flat bed was comfortable, mattress topper, cotton sheets, duvet and pillowsDeparted on timePremium Economy seat is better than Economy in that there is more leg roomArrived on time and immediately went for a coffee and a snack at the airport-which of course should have been served as a breakfast on the flightI would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews I\'ve taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativityThis was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversaryNaturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a Barcelona FC matchThe agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it leftWhile we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people wereI arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to JohannesburgThe flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at JohannesburgLuckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the BA check in desk to ask for new tickets to Cape TownLoyal customer for 28 yearsThe flight leaves from Heathrow Terminal 5, normally Beijing flight leaves from B Gates, so I made myself comfortable at the B Gate lounge which is 100 times better thanIt was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable, though quite fullCX may have better seat but BA sometime offers good valueThe service is gooda frequent flyer may be recognized and get treated betterIt was an on time flight.Round trip was overall on time without delayOnline check in was easy and got to pick out the seats I wantedPicked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problemsThe food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professionalWashrooms were cleanOverall a satisfactory experienceNothing special for a short flight but was happy that it was on timeIt is interesting that for short haul flight BA uses seating that the business seats are the same as Economy except that the central seat is kept emptyI normally prefer aisle seats for long haul but this flight I chose a window seat, because it was an A380 flight on the upper deckThe upper deck situation means that I can take advantage of a window side drawer where apart from easy storage I can also put something on topBA\'s Premium Economy service is good, the food is not the same for economy as in the case of some airlines, and the seat acceptably comfortableAll in all the flight was satisfactory.To our amazement, we went to board our flight back to London after our holiday in the West Coast of the USA and found we were upgraded from Economy toIt was especially nice for my fianc\xc3\xa9e who has only flown economy previouslyThe service and food were very good and the flat-bed seat made the flight much more pleasantThe A380 is a lovely aircraft because it is so quiet and looks very smart inside.I decided to treat myself to British Airways premium economy from Beijing to London, which was not much more expensive than economyI had a bulkhead seat which meant I had plenty of legroom and could stretch out on the flightThe cabin looked a bit tired but the staff were friendly and professional and I was comfortableThe food was quite good but a glass of champagne when we boarded would have been niceOn our recent holiday to the USA, I was very excited to be flying on the new A380 for the first timeAfter some food in the excellent Terminal 5 we went to board and found we were upgraded to Premium EconomyThe aircraft was smart and fresh inside and we were welcomed with champagneThe A380 is by far the quietest aircraft I have ever flown and the IFE was good with lots of choiceThe food was decent and we had friendly and professional service on the plane and at Heathrow.Flight to LHR was smooth and with good serviceBut a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into, so that I could hold on to it on approachThat was a very nice touch I hadn\'t been offered before on any airline I\'ve flown with.The short flight from London Gatwick to Amsterdam was ok, flight crew spoke to the cabin a few times, which I appreciateMy catering choice was water and crisps, hardly "full service" but at least it was free.Despite earlier weather problems and with storm Katie approaching, they made the effort to operate a flight back to the Isle of Man and got us all homeWell done BA!Bottom line is, whatever carries the British Airway brand name is goodSandwich and a drink okay Crew were happy and helpful, cabin clean and looked newWas on time and landed early\r\n\r\nOnce we took off flight was okay, typical service with sandwich and drinkWine was passableBetter than most shorthaul economy service, seat was comfortable given the limited legroom.Barcelona to Seoul Incheon via London Heathrow, and overall I was very impressed with my two flights on BAThe flight from London to Seoul was on the new 787 and was almost perfectA very friendly, professional crew, IFE was of a very high quality and amazing soundI was impressed by the size of both meals (lunch and hot breakfast)From now on I\'ll book Economy and pay for exit seats - it\'s a no-brainerLondon Heathrow to Houston on British Airways, and very friendly and efficient serviceWe chose Asian Vegetarian as meals which turned out to be tastyHadn\'t flown BA long-haul for over 10 years and improvement was noticeableFree beverages were offered and there was a wide choice tooBaggage allowance was very adequateThe transfer at Terminal 5 at LHR worked very well.The plane was satisfactory to meThe A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the wayThe upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quietThe food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Jo-burgCabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice jobBA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpfulNonstop flights that are routed over the Atlantic Ocean tend to be much smoother.Food for breakfast was okay although not enough if you were hungryBut luckily they provide champagne during the flight.
