ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its serviceIn a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciationQuite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its "Business Class" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seatedI was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisenShort-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefitsWhile cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etcBA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengersOn boarding at Gatwick, realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reservingApparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reasonWe didn\'t accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money backVery second rate shoddy airline.They downgraded me from business to premium economyThey took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUDThe downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them - I need toThe wait for them to get around to me has been numbingThe insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradationThe systems under which BA operates are some sort of medieval torture.Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board, only to be informed we were on the wrong place andour boarding wasn\'t allowed yetService was slow, and as usual, choices of food to purchase ran out before they\'d reached row 24I requested a cup of tea which never appearedThe over officious senior flight attendant, who\'d been facilitating in \'Club Europe\' appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests (whilst still in mid flight) making an already uncomfortablejourney feel worseNever again BA, never again!\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Caught up in the Gatwick cancellation fiasco; at some point between what was smooth check in (unable to do online as part of group travel) and security, the flightwas cancelled; (we were denied entry to security and departures as a result)It was at this point that we discovered BA Gatwick are not BA, but a masquerade, who are unable to help and and provide very little assistance unless the \'realBA\' provide information, and even though our baggage was now airside, didn\'t have a clue as to how we could get it back(Difficult to give a rating for cabin service as we didn\'t even board the aircraft)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0BA has a real problem with boarding it\'s flightsCabin staff don\'t bother implementing their own rulesBoarding this flight took an hour as a result of this nonsenseThe incoming flight was late already so our 90 minute flight was 90 minutes late.Our connecting flight from London to Glasgow was canceled and we were forced to wait 12 hours in the airport for a new flightWhen we received our luggage at Glasgow we discovered that our luggage was soaking wetMy wife\xe2\x80\x99s luggage contents were wet and had to be air dried.The worst airline I have ever flown withNo chance of getting any sleep, question asked of possible seat movement ignored and getting bumped the entire time by cabin crew walking or pushing kart up and down aislewithout one apologyAs we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn\'t print onto the ticket for some reasonUnfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economyMy girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn\'t have any food which we had pre booked also and sheWe were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flightThey ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet areaWe then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruinedBritish Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn\'t speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in useWe felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do nextit was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2how wrong I wasBritish airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insuranceBritish Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpasteI filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven\'t even had the decency to even respondThey are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about themDo not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customersOh and don\'t bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back.Just returned from Chicago, flew out 10 days ago on American Airlines absolutely superb in every way, had high expectations on return flight with BA.\xe2\x80\xa8What a disappointment.\xe2\x80\xa8The Airbus A380 maybe nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful.\xe2\x80\xa8Very uncomfortable seats, the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight, the inflight mealwas inedible and the service was mediocre at bestBA standards continue to decline every time I fly with themThis time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staffThe Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not copeHow many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low costAs a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEOand sadly the staff service has declined year on yearOnboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BAare too tight with their budgetOnboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided.AwfulBusiness class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaoticBusiness lounge overfull, couldn\'t get seatsDelayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gateThe meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlinesNot looking forward to the flight home.Not a reliable airlineYou cannot trust the timing at allI had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clearThey have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in GenevaHow come they bring a not working plane to the gateWhen I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don\'t have a seatA lot of stressIn the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meetingI thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it\'s routine for BA not to fly on time.I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I\'m not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The onlyreason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up pointsLondon to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curryCouldn\'t check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs earlyTo be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being \'bumped\' to economyThis airline fails to deliver time and time againIt is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative.The worst journey in my lifeThe connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delayI had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attackDespite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lostI was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference numberBA phone number at SJC simply never answerI called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery addressI had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty websiteI claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receiptI was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJCBad customer serviceThe only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BANever again!The airplanes and the lounges are worn out, old and brokenFrom Dallas to Heathrow, multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designedThe first class seating from Heathrow to Dubrovnik was nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticketVery disappointed.One of the worst experiences on the worst airlineThe flight was delayed due to earlier technical issuesThe time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelledThere was zero information givenDespite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flightWhen it was finally cancelled, the BA staffAfter another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute waitBy now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BABA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodationThere were people with young children who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and leftThe following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flightOverall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airlineI will not ever use them again.I got a \xc2\xa310 meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a 14 hour flightNever again will I fly BAI would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again.The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in HeathrowWhen I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they deniedI will never fly this awful airline againAs you can see from the picture they hardly were business classHorrible flightIn addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priorityThey gave us about 5 different excuses for the delayThey were very rudeAnd from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayedThere was no place to comfortably store items in business classThe seat controls didn\xe2\x80\x99t work wellThe power outlet didn\xe2\x80\x99t workThere was no internet the entire flightThe overhead luggage bin was too heavyI almost got a hernia having to close itThis is a horrible airlineI\xe2\x80\x99ll never fly with them againI fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there\xe2\x80\x99s no other option therefore they frankly don\xe2\x80\x99t have to care about the customerThe flights are always delayed and it\xe2\x80\x99s always someone else\xe2\x80\x99s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it all and for thelife of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operateI\xe2\x80\x99ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world\xe2\x80\x99s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worstIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliffdo not expect BA to get you to your destination in time.Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take off, we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problemAfter engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked forwas no one to help usIn fact everyone refused to help usAnyone with a connecting flight couldn\'t rebook on the application because the app wouldn\'t disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this butstill refused to help usNow it\'s 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with thatSo i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a roomI don\'t have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no oneOf course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven\'t heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I\'ll be reimbursed,even though I\'m not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifferenceIt\'s financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it\'s impossible to reach them byI feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or informationMy initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flightThen I was automatically rescheduled for next dayNext day, the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las VegasAs a result, I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las VegasI opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over 5 weeks now, not a single feedback from British AirwaysI will avoid all flights with them in future, and will share this story.We will never fly British Airways againOur flight on July 15 2023 from LHR to LAX was cancelled 20 hours before departure without any explanationSince 8 weeks we are now waiting for the refund and BA does not pay us the cost caused by the cancellationVery disappointing.Overall an OK flight but Club Europe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel very premium these days.British Airways has confirmed itself as the worst airline in the UKLast minute cancellation, no explanation, refusal to book with another airline \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an arrangement with them\xe2\x80\x9dWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened to what used to be our national airline?Worst BA experienceAt the counter I was told that I had been off-loaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelledHowever, I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than I was supposed tois just missing from my bookinggets droppedMy daughter and I were denied boarding on our business class flight from Madrid to Heathrow in March 25, 2023, the first leg on our return flight to Victoria, CanadaNo reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us toExpedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to whyPart of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flightThis nine day delay was a major problem for usI had to miss work and my daughter was missing schoolFurther, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra daysAnd then nothingI sent numerous follow up emails, and received no repliesIt is now months later, and still I have not heard from British AirwaysThis is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decadesI think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at British Airways.Flight cancelled, no crew! 9th September 2023, not peak holiday period so why such bad management by BA? Sent to the gate left standing of over and hour and thenflight cancelledWhy does BA continue to provide such poor service - a national disgrace.The worst service ever, my baggage did not arrive on timeBoth my flights were delayedI will never fly them again Even the food was bad and your service.4/4 flights we booked this holiday were delayed about 1-2 hoursNo wifi available on 2 of 4 flights Food and drinks very basic and expensiveCannot recommendBritish Airways has a total lack of respect for its customersI was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA withoutThe worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customersThe ground staff\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had toThey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengersThey did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although otherThe reason given for both cancellations was \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical reasons\xe2\x80\x9dNo assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etcTheir attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirsI received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t acceptable as I had to getI rang BA\xe2\x80\x99s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me byThey just don\xe2\x80\x99t careIn the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours andAt least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now.This makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboardThe WiFi worked for only half the flight and there are no refundsService onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmthCare and support shockingLies and misleading unprofessional serviceTold that my flight was cancelledTold technical fault with my original flightAt airport, check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in dayWhy take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place! How can youFlying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginableHow could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happySeats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raisedThere is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping The whole business class set up is a sick jokeEating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall offAre there any redeeming features - the answer is noBritish Airways absolutely does not careMy reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awfulAfter enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can doNo water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore itI used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrierI guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and serviceMy last trip to London was with Delta, they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become.My recent experience with British Airways was not just horrendous, it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their partI arrived at JFK ready for my flight to Malaga, only to find it had been cancelled with zero noticeThe nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son\'s weddingThirty agonizing hours later, the bags showed up\xe2\x80\x94but my brand-new iPad and a special watch for my nephew were missingThe items weren\'t merely valuable; they had emotional significance, which made the loss even more gut-wrenchingYou\'d think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline creditTheir customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callousTheir response was, in essence, "It\'s your fault for trusting us with your belongings." This isn\'t just poor customer service; it\'s a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibilityBritish Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not toIf you have any respect for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid British Airways at all costsThey not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err, leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence.This is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to ItalyOur trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us, coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us (9All flights were lateOn arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BAAlso, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to RomeBA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife\'sI was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hourTaking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusableAll flights were lateWe arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away)After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BAWe are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA\xe2\x80\x99s errorsWe stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the planewe boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals servedNo effort to apologiseWhat a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many thingsI paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficientAvoid BA if you have any other option nowadays, they are the worst in Europe.Then there was an announcement: they won\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone in anymoreMe and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let inThe reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it wasAfter the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be let in anymoreNothing changed and everyone was sent awayI had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the planeSince they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able torebook my or anyone\xe2\x80\x99s flight nor get anyone refundedI waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until todayTrying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversationWhen they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flightBut the people at the counter said they could not do anything about itI was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for itNot only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebooknot know if I ever got it backed.Filthy plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less when dealing with a complaintFood was poor, they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate familiesNot really what you expect when you pay for the extra serviceWill be cancelling our other bookings we have with BA, even if that means we lose our deposit.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Chaos at Terminal 5 with BA cancellations and delays, and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask9 out 10 answers were liesSadly, BA airport standards at T5 are worse than ever, and we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuseAs a short haul club Europe trip, I expect very little from BA any more, and they barely even provide that, with cutbacks during Covid that are now permanentSadly, on my route BA have a monopoly.\xc2\xa0BA cancelled our flight and could not book us onto any flight for the next 4 daysI had to spend \xc2\xa35k in expenses to get us back with another airline2 months later I am still waiting for reimbursement and have had no response to my 3 written complaintsEven the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the telephone number and email for the department who deal with this, so even they cannot escalateUtterly useless.\r\ncanceled an no reason givenAs we were already at the airport, we proceeded to check in to ask what caused the cancellation (apparently the pilot was sick and there was nobody available on standby)The Business Class check-in desk assistant, was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our bags for the following dayWe were not offered a refund, nor told how to claim for the extra expenses incurred (train, change fees for the connecting flight to Zimbabwe, loss of one night stayat a very expensive safari lodge etc), we were not offered anythingSnooty, unprofessional, uncaring, disorganised (lack of) serviceAvoid British Airways and find better and cheaper options.The headphones however were cheap and didn\'t feel or work particular goodOne draw back to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider didn\'t open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling8 months have passed and still wasting my time with the BA team sharing the same documents again and againOur flight from Delhi to London got delayed in December 2022 so we missed the connecting flight from London Heathrow to VancouverOn reaching Vancouver we were told our baggage was lostSuch a horrible experience and their Customer Relations person did not even look into the details already shared in December, January, April, and July.In June my flight was cancelled within three hours of departureWas given a rebooking the next day and they lost my suitcaseWhen trying to post a claim, the website doesn\'t workNever again, BA.When it comes to catering, Club Class has been reduced to what Economy wasOn flight BA621, the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edgesMy slice of Camembert was dried- why bother serving it? My bread roll, white olive bread, was dryClub class has become Economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in Club class Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a glorified, soulless bus trip, without Britishness.Our flight was unfortunately delayed by 2 hrs from 2245 to 0120 causing us to miss a connection from Gatwick to Turin and making it so that no lounges wereIn flight entertainment system didn\xe2\x80\x99t work very well, the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use, it could use updatingAfter we missed our connection and we\xe2\x80\x99re stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts, they rebooked us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the next day, gaveOne family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without successFlight delayed by an hour, it happens, no biggieSecond gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for 6\'3" travel bud.The staff are very rude and not trained properlyNo exceptions are made for children and elderly peopleThe price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poorFailed at all basic travel fundamentals: 1) Our flight was delayedThe fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored3) Staff were quite unpleasant.They lost my baggage in a very simple situationIt\'s been three weeks and they don\'t care, no communication whatsoeverAnd then they lose itNow it\'s been three weeks, no communication whatsoever, the online status is still \xe2\x80\x9cSearching for your bag\xe2\x80\x9d with no updatesMy conclusion is that the BA males no effort to find my missing bag and they don\'t care.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Late boarding led to a one hour flight leaving two hours lateOnce on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.As usual the flight is delayedBA try to blame someone for the inability and incapacity of delivering what they sellWhy don\'t you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand.Couldn\'t recommend BA more on this flight todayArrived at check in to find we had been bumped off due to oversellingNo BA staff availableAirlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice.One minor irritant: for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with WiFiThe journey got off on an unpleasant note - the Business Class line at Keflav\xc3\xadk was so long that it looked like an Economy Class check-inIt took over 30 mins to get throughThere was no lounge access offeredBritish Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacantYou don\'t even get extra pitchTerrible Experience with British AirwaysEn route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelledI checked the BA website and couldn\'t find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refundThat\'s when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase "abandoned" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for meOf course they don\'t explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceedAnd even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budgeI had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words noout of pocket costs for the tripOnce this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I hadAnd because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn\'t travel bytrain to my cousin\'s place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn\'t want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me upThis cost me another \xc2\xa3125 in room and meal costsDespite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn\'t budgeMy feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands ofI\'ve been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn\'t careThey said there was nothing they could doI used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinionOnce I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.An airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is British AirwaysI am not joking we are a family of 7 all in Business Class heading for a Norwegian and Arctic Cruise and they lost 10 of our bags! They willnever see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airlineCheck-in Desk rude and dismissiveStaff uncommunicative, did not know what baggage allowance entitled to, once raised (politely) became argumentative and accusatory.What a disaster! First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problemI also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that\xe2\x80\x99s the only service they provide on weekendsThen, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowingAfter 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelledThen, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airportNo information was provided, no solutions were offeredNo money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was givenI also had pre-purchased food and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide the serviceAll in all, terribleNever again!They notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for! Then they cancelled a flightthe flight that I have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into LHRwith a knee injury) - cannot do and now they won\'t change it - even though they have a direct flight from LAX to LHR with Premium Economy and unacceptableflight allows us 54 mins to transfer flights at JFK - and my husband won\'t be able to walk slowly, let alone quickly, after enduring the 6-hour flight from LAXI have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and I also have online chat which proves I did not accept this re-routed flight to JFK but they won\'t budge.A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyoneLittle did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 poundsUpon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) andI had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticketZero empathy was shownZero alternative was offeredTwo days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had \'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight\'They\'ve continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped respondingSo in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refundIt keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving lateThere was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updatedThe pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperworknot BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step ofFood best avoidedIs dry ice so expensive that BA can\'t afford it?I don\'t understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocreThe food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul tripSome members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experienceThis really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experienceotherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience.I\'m sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business classLong wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spokeCustomer Service does not existOne world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or \xe2\x80\x9ccomputer says no\xe2\x80\x9dOfficial BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hoursDelayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original timeGot to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not helpBack on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, round and roundThen found out flight left 2 hours delayedPaid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that\xe2\x80\x99sOur A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technicalAll the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelledThe fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn\'t care less about customers, have no interestGiven its our flights that pay BA\'s way, I\'d suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customersNot recommended.Horrible airlineDoes not care about their customersUsed to be decent but has now since really fell offA flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn\'t even offer juicesThings have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemicThe aircraft look wornFor example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landedThe touch screen function on my screen did not workThe USB charger ports on my seat did not workThe staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doingThe food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemicThey then told us that we\xe2\x80\x99d get first choice at the second service which they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver onFinally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tastelessThis has been by far the worst service I have had on a planeIt\'s very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about youWe had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-inThen they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartmentsOnce we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn\'t leave the boarding areaI will never fly this airline again!On trying to check in I was told my ticket \xe2\x80\x98did not exist\xe2\x80\x99I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticketThey have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me \xc2\xa3265I do not intend to let this matter goA company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refundPS, they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve itBA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respectYou pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the planeThis is short-changing passengers.These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70\'s and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet wouldmean climbing over a person on the aisleBut there were no other seats availableShe did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordabilityShe said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failedWe spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympatheticFor 12 hours we sufferedBA Economy is absolutely awfulThe evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older personWe arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanationAs if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! There was no explanation, no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flightWe\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to find another flight from Stansted but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t until much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short tripI simply don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why BA don\xe2\x80\x99t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation, and work with them to resolve the problemShocking customer service!Original flight was cancelled with no explanationThere was no representative to help in rebooking We had to call customer service (long distance call) The line kept dropping Had to do 40 + calls to find newNo help with hotel for the night stay.Flight was delayed with no communication givenBoarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staffSeats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possibleThere is next to no reclineIf the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraftNo amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but smallIt\'s my third day here in North Carolina and still waiting for my luggageThey didn\'t even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flightMy flight on on 12 May 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 May 2023 as the arrivalThe team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023The cancellation of of these booking is not refundableto the delay and cancellation of our flightBritish Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional chargesThe refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every weekI was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properlyEvery-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for paymentAfter multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this levelThe whole experience was terrible.Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothingNot even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay forThe BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extraAnd don\'t get me started on their customer service helplinetalk loudly without any consideration for the passengersHeathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivalsIt is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BAWhen my bag finally arrived 7 days later, the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searchedSomeone emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about, I felt violatedI have been treated appallingly from start to finishMy luggage was mis-tagged in Dallas on my way to Cairo via LondonHowever, upon arrival due to the luggage being mis-tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage, it was never sent to CairoIts sitting in Terminal 3 in LHR (I have an air tag on my luggage) and British Airways is saying there is nothing they can do about itI have filed 3 claims, made 13 phone calls, have been hung up on 3x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at BA refuseThe airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire tripThey gave me no updates, their website sucks, and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phoneThey appease me on the phone, tell me they\xe2\x80\x99re fixing it, but nothing changesThe hotel can\xe2\x80\x99t get in touch with them and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t even tried to pick to bag back upSeveral times, when I called I got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to \xe2\x80\x9ccall back later\xe2\x80\x9d.Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergencyFor the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund \xe2\x80\x94 we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and anabsence of meaningful customer serviceOur phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers orexplanations, we were told it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot possible\xe2\x80\x9d to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of thisabysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAAIn response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a \xe2\x80\x9cfull refund\xe2\x80\x9d but that could not beThey would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showedWe never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refundWe will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance.First time flying with BA business class, never againMy meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wineNot looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight.Not helping matters is the fact that the BA prebooking shop for food didn\'t recognise the flight number, and the onboard  WiFi didn\'t work.But on my flight, there was none because of "supply issues"I didn\'t eat, so I paid \xc2\xa3100 for nothingAbsolutely horrible airlineCommunication is terribleLast minute delays, cancellations, seat changes with no communicationSeats are cramped and uncomfortableOverpricedWould not fly again.Having experienced delays and cancellations departing from USA to Europe and now a 3.5 hour estimated delay at LHR heading back to USA, I would warn travelers that BA hasbecome unreliable and is now on my \xe2\x80\x9cDo Not Fly\xe2\x80\x9d list until they get better organized.Return flight landed early - BUT - we then had a 1 1/4 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we thenBut, as usual, Economy class seating was truly dreadful - no legroom at allNo better in Club class either - only the middle seat left freeMarked down because of thisThis flight failed at every levelWe were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us butWe pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still inHaving only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holidayI might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had availableBeware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the restThey won\'t treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakesA mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flightWe landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next planePlus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landedAnd now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensationWe paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnightThat is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it rightSo beware potential travelers!Horrible serviceI get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flightGiven a seat that is different than what I paid extra for ?! It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame for such well known airline.I flew with numerous airlines, but I gotta admit, British Airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer supportI waited 3 weeks for a ticket changeCall center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang upThey told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never gotThey don\'t have a live chat just like American Airlines do, they don\'t have a online form to submit your questions, they don t have a working international numberTotal garbage.Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flightThe kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-inWe got stuck in security because of that, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what was wrongFlight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night beforeIt was hard to see mobile phone screenI better call to say hey sorry I screwed upYour flight is not going to work for meI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to waste one night in LondonThe most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answeredShe was brutalI can\xe2\x80\x99t do anythingShe basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputerBut if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you call? You are at faultJust so callous and uncaringShe wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change feesMore money from me because of BA\xe2\x80\x99s utter contempt for their passengersBut never this level of cruelty because of one simple errorNever againHow do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.TerribleI have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flightsThe customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as I no longer intend to use BA for any further flightsTerrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff.The customer service is uglyTried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flightWill never fly British Airway ever again.Most uncomfortable flight I have ever experiencedIt\'s a long time since I have flown long-haul, the cramped conditions were awful BA seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade, this has not worked on me, I will avoid flying BA in futureOn the return flight from Santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm, I feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service, they just disappear behind theOur flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flightWe were rescheduled before we even landedThey booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursementWe were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the nightWe thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home\xe2\x80\xa6.we were wrongOur flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over1.5 hr further delayWhen arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departureThey sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can\xe2\x80\x99t get you out until tomorrowUnfortunately the drama continuesThe two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did notWe have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the otherI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who\xe2\x80\x99 has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don\'t want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come close to theI will never fly British Airways again, and Delta\xe2\x80\x99s baggage people are not doing great either.On one occasion I did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with meAll in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of British Airways.BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes, club rentals, tees, ballsThen the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flightI contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservationBA customer service was horrendous and make false promisesI will never use this airlines againBeware of British AirwaysThey also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members.All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extentWhat\'s not understandable is that they weren\'t prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that theyrebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would findan extra room since BA didn\'t communicate properly with themI gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that wereI contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn\'t address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they justghosted meThe flight schedule was delayed for one hourAfter boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutesWhen we arrived in London, we were delayed again for at least another 30 minutes to find a gateVery painful trip (disrupted our vacation)Not flying with BA anymore if I can find alternative Airlines.The worst experience in all my years of travelMy first flight with my two kids from Boston to London was delayed by 2 hours, resulting in me missing my connecting flightUnfortunately, even that flight was delayedI would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline, even if it means paying a bit more for a different option.The worst experience in all my years of travelBag was destroyed, flight delayed 3 hours and couldn\'t get water on boardThen when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that wouldn\'t workYou can\'t contact themPlane was filthy and someone else\'s belongings and left over food was still in our seat.Terrible delaysHad to rebook our domestic travel for 5 passengers and haven\xe2\x80\x99t received any reimbursement on the sameLost all my luggage; received luggage after 4 daysNo customer service rep picks up the phone.A serious medical problem appeared while I was onboardUnfortunately I was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell I becameAlso I could not find my way back home in my conditionI haven\'t flown British Airways before and will never fly them again! The check-in process was terrible and slowIt should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of timeOur group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter serviceWe had to run to the gate and we did make it, but they were terrible!When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed myGetting off the plane was when the real nightmare took placeOur flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flightThey put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flightI waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me "Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BAservice desks for further assistance." If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogethertelling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn\'t rebook anyoneIt was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helplineAll the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don\'t have it), most of thecustomer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused meThey acted like I was inconveniencing them with "my issues"I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were bookedOverall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I\'ve ever had to deal withI will never book with this company againI would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again.Food averageWorst seats I have ever encountered in economy classNo leg room at allStaff at the terminal rudeThey cram people in seats with no legroom and block off the same seat type at the front of the plane (where there is more legroom) just so the \xe2\x80\x9cbusinessPlane is old with no onboard entertainment for a 3 hours flightLast time I will fly British Airways.Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines,and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to flyDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time or moneyCustomer service is non-existentWe used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in yearsWelp not with this companyI understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWNPlease take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their websiteI had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered#2 \xe2\x80\x93 When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issuesNO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that\xe2\x80\x99s#5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALLNO EMAIL, NO TEXT#7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid#9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 \xe2\x80\x93 If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other andNOT NOTIFY YOUI will never use them againThe BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a\xc2\xa0 zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhereWorse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins lateHard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it\'s time for BA\'s CEO and management focused onI thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with\xc2\xa0the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines.\xc2\xa0Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasantI paid over \xc2\xa3300 for a business class round tripThe inflight magazine is no longer availableThere are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainmentThe inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other timesI really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the moneyWords fail to describe this last awful flight - baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the longflight LHR/SFO, it\'s understandable for a baby to cry nonstop - but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heardin the cabin - that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep (always difficult anyway westbound)The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd serviceWhat happened to the really nice tea and scones? I\'ve said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.edon\'t do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please! The lounge wasso packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat - poor BA is on the skids downhill.Absolutely terrible experienceThe app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did not accept them even when providedI was trying to fly back to the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errorsI went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plentyI was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the USA, all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paidBA overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customerIt means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggageThe server in Itsu in the BA terminal says she stopped flying BA years ago due to the service being bad all the timeMost customers she serves have a complaint Staff don\'t care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to payThe seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! Youcan get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won\'t use them again.Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn\xe2\x80\x99t positiveAdequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengersIf BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could haveAnother bad showI wasn\'t going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwiseAfter having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then renegedAs it was a special anniversary it suckedUnbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailableI had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refundedThe representative on the phone informed me he wasn\'t sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of myI never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total backSince then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked meI\'ve lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show.I will never travel with British Airways againI spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UKThey have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to goSecond, the food was disgustingThird, the service terribleFifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anythingSixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways)Seventh, the charging points did not workThat was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one pieceTo add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small planeThis is why I got the worst seat in the house going outThis is the most appalling airline service I have ever encounteredThere is no point paying for business class in British Airways.I am already in Portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because I was 10 minutes late calling them, even though I tried for 2 hoursNow I am unable to get back and they have kept the 500 poundsCustomer service is shocking, they have no intention of helping you.TerribleAvoid this airlineIt\xe2\x80\x99s now becoming regular practice to cancel flightsHad a cancellation from Switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellationThe airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices.Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of theirterrible serviceThere are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being toldYou can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they sayThe downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interactThe amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlinesThe restrooms on the flight are very small, and don\'t provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlinesNo free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptableAnother example of BA\'s penny pinching in recent yearsRegarding the staff and customer service: PoorInattentiveThere was also no offer of any snacksRude at timesMy partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirtyThe attendant was incredibly rude in responseThis left us shockedwhereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal serviceThis is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of serviceThe food was pretty badBoth were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridgeThe vegetables were discoloured and flavourlessThe breakfast wasn\'t much betterThe customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seatYou pay a premium price for a very average serviceWhen I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missingAfter a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer serviceThe woman at the airport didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference numberBut then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly homeI made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have my bagIn January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple emailI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help meI am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service.Food was lousyWho ever is planning the Asian Hindu Vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includesThe snack was also lousyThe place was chaoticWe get to our boarding gate and again a long line with 40 minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding passOverall not a good airline.Had the worst experienceThe flight from London to Toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to HalifaxWe were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years, despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpfulWe waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at 12 am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay thatAt least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodationWe will NOT to travel on this airline again.The ground staff were not helpfulFelt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anywayTravelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with British AirwaysLogged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answerLost some of our luggageIt was not a good experience.We paid extra to choose our seatsSince they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought, they seated us in totally different seatsI asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flightFrom London to LAX was worse, nobody in the airport help usIt was a nightmare this airlineWe missed one day work and BA didn\xe2\x80\x99t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats.At Copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlinesTime on board never changed, no fixed counter at AirportAbysmal service that needs vast improvement hereWorst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British AirwaysSo many issues with getting from one destination to the otherHad an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertaintiesI wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic \xe2\x80\x9cwe are sorry\xe2\x80\x9d email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 onNeedless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even address one single issue expressed to themIt was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the faceThe most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying andI can\xe2\x80\x99t describe how cheated I feltI booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and itwas inedibleUnsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even send an emailTo add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seenSince the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful What I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.endless BA cost cuttingThe toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doingEndless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% fullNo hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cuttingCabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don\'t care any morePaid \xc2\xa34.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 minsSad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadaysDo not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping.\xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t recommend British Airways at allI tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging upThey are excusing themselves in the high volume of callsI write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigateIt is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another serviceThey sent you online but you don\'t receive a PDF fileYou need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive itExpensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their websiteAn airline that definitely wouldn\'t recommendIt is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors aroundAbsolutely horrible experienceThe Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weatherThe BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weatherI was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cabIberia said they do not reimburse due to the weatherWhen complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburseAbsolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don\'t want to takeDid they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information.This is the worst airlineNot one thing went rightI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how they have got it so badBags took over 40 minutes to arriveHorrendousI will never fly British Airways againTo start, the plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no reason givenAnd those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortableI could not believe they called this business class.Worst aircraft I have ever flownThe seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in frontwhich for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptableMy food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vileI would not entertain using BA againWe expected so much more.The was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at T5, so in total from landing to getting the doorsopen it took 30 minutesWhy do you make it so hard? After a so so lounge experience, the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contemptIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be training, who would do that, it has to be no fear of anything happeningThe crew were professional but I personally found the food menu rather oddEssentially, there was one only main that I could handle and was then told they had ran outMy luggage was destroyed, wheels torn offI made a claim with British Airways to reimburse me but because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the receipt for my old luggage, they would only cover 50% of my new luggageAdvice, have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don\xe2\x80\x99t get ripped off like I did.Literally the worst flight of my lifeAfter booking tickets together with my partner, we were then separated: \xe2\x80\x98sorry, the flight is full.\xe2\x80\x99 The flight then took off 45 minutes late - no apologyThe trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows, and the response was flippant and rude: \xe2\x80\x98whoopsWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 Genuinely appalling from beginning to endMight as well fly Easy Jet - at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service, not like BAI swore I would never fly BA again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to BudapestObviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent yearsPrices have increased and services have gone downThe most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don\xe2\x80\x99t need to get worse haveThe check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constantshouting and bullyingHowever there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious.Lost 3 out of 4 checked bagsDenied wheelchair assistance at LHR for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by footRude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05, 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of waterHorrible flight with disappointing staffCustomer service is terrible and online check-in never worked because BA never verified our COVID documents which were uploaded in advance, resulting me and my wife seated separatelyI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost respect for British AirwaysDisgusted.Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlinesAt booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seatAt Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the leastThe lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many yearsThis was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flightNext time they change CEO, can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate, budget Irish airline.Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organisedCome to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-outStill terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seatsSecurity at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without \'secundary\' checksThe South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disasterEnglish tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don\'t understand BA stuck to it through the yearsNo-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey..On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connectVery poor service, very frustratingFirstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me, the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct orWe (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questionsThe room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortableAlthough I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the receptionGenerally poorSent to gate on time, sat maybe 30 minutes, was then announced as crew were not familiar with the A321 there would be a delayClearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statementWatched the crew walk through to the gate, my impression was they did not want to be thereNo further updates or sight of crew for next two hours, then attempted to charge us for even a glass of waterBA changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seatsHeld up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff, allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trialQueued at security for 20 minutes.BA changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seatsBoarding was chaosStaff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the holdFlight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzelsThis airline is going downhill rapidly.Just a few days before I was meant to fly, my wife broke her footI called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not wellThey told me that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wellHowever, they never sent me the ticketThey made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either \xc2\xa3316 on top of the \xc2\xa3450 that I paid previouslyI found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paidEach time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay \xc2\xa3360I made a complaint, and nothing happened.Every flight was delayedNow we are back at the airport in Miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flightThe last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they can\'t do anythingI was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receivesNot one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasantFood was revolting, they don\'t even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary mealThe last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slidIt was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the companyThe pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it\'s just a sipOn the shorter flights the seats couldn\'t even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on\r\nThe worst cabin experience ever: cramped seats, very low cost style and uncomfortableCatering is also a shame: 250ml of water + a chocolate bar for a 5 hours serviceWill never fly BA again.The meals weren\'t that great to be honestAfter landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gateWhen I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn\'t make it due to the short connection time in LondonThe latest affrontStood in first class line for an hourArrogant and unapologeticAdd this to a long list of post-Covid disappointmentsBritish Airways only notified me of the first change, but not the secondThey tried to charge an $800 change feeAt the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problemsThe confirmation documentation from British Airways was of no valueI was left stranded at the airport.I tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possibleI was given no reason for thisI telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect informationBA customer service was virtually non existentI will never fly with them again.A catalogue of failuresWe flew from Belfast to Heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hoursWe missed our onward Air Canada flight to Calgary as a resulttheir British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hoursWe are now on our way home only to find our Heathrow to Belfast flight, which had already been cancelled and put back 2 hours, is now delayed by anotherAvoid British Airways like the plague.\r\nOur flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especiallyComplimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium howeverCabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-upInbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilitiesand trains on the other end were being cancelled alreadyWe boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reasonIt\'s truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight toPilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn\'t even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delaySeats for this flight were horrendous and the new \'slimline\' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwardsThese seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortableWe landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we\'d been stranded for hoursWe\'d spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slotGiven 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don\'t fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences,Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelledNo one able to help at LHR, said to use the appRebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guaranteeThe 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happenedArrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelledNo emails, no texts, nothingRebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worseOverall, dreadfulThey just don\'t care and hide behind apps and automated call centresPlane was over an hour late leaving, no problem that can happenBut on arrival at Heathrow, the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go toThen once at the stand we waited another 45 minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the planeJust pathetically inefficient.BA\'s premium is the worst I have come acrossThe flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok, the flight back was in a plane that should not be usedOld, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the buttonThey have fallen far behind their competitors, they were once my preferred airline but now I try and avoid at all costsI would rather pay more and fly with someone else.This was literally one of the worst experiencesI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to an airport sinceIt began in Orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hoursPoor customer service and just ignored at timesThen missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bagsAnother 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flightI was cut off three times and told I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get home that day despite several flights being availableJust booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party.The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known forIt turned out to be a horror show of incompetenceJust under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelledDespite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could helpThe result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a humanIf this is the service level for silver members I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what a regular punter has to put up withWhen asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand my frustrationNot ideal as I\xe2\x80\x99d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and notUpon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlierNo notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelledIncomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happenedAt this point, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to explode with anger or cryLuckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook usUnfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old babyThis was not a pleasant experienceThe plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed tohave cut back on this service tooAll in all, another shocking BA serviceA lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeksSAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic controlWhen I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone (half of the plane missed it).We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flightI spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phoneMy baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage formsThe incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA\'s faultThen when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridgeAll told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gateTotal disruption, wasted timeAbsolutely no excuse for this.Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refusedEven though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refusedIt turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn\'t let all the passengers on the planeSo quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned awayI sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has beenThey wouldn\'t acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalfEvery time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn\'tI am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go awayWell, you know what I won\'t.As usual the flight is delayed this week, it already 3 hours and I\xe2\x80\x99m held on a bus waiting to get taken to the planeI really can\xe2\x80\x99t explain how much I detest British AirwaysIf it was a cheap budget airline I could accept it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s premium prices for the most unreliable service.Pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food optionsThey moved our seats away from each other and we shouldn\'t have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together! We haven\'teven flown yet, this airline is horrible.The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off periodAs it was the weekend here I was unable to reach their office until Monday when they advised me there was no refund (other than fees) as I had missedI have now cancelled the ticket and I will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying British Airways.The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economyTried 3 times BA provide telephone number, total useless, no help, given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the emailI now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgradeThis is completely unacceptableWhat has happened to this company? I have had better treatment from Ryanair.Flew premium, only worth the extra money for the bit of extra roomPenny pinching means there\xe2\x80\x99s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organisedNew planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you\xe2\x80\x99re in a dentist waiting roomDevoid of any personality or joyOnly fly if the only option, only fly premium if it\xe2\x80\x99s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the middleFirst our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight, understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however it lost us one day\'s experience in CairoWe were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats, on both flightsAs my husband had spasms, he had to stretch his legs across my lap, and not once did ANY of the attendants ask if we were okay as we wereclearly strugglingThe A380 was nearly full, rather poor amenity bagThe meal was ok but not great, aside the Champagne no European wines on this flightAfter landing 50 minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority.My original flight was cancelled just over 2 weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available, British airways affected the trip I plannedIt feels like BA is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service.Poor communicationBritish Airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airlineCustomer service is impossible to contact and it seems BA tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when it\'s available.On the other hand on board - huge line for toilets - 45 min into a 2.30 min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed -They announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slowOn asking why: "They did not give us enough cups for hot drinksAnd the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip"Check in was so slow, no self check in and bag dropMy review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delaysI looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelledThe person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelledThe woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you\xe2\x80\x9dShe refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance deskI am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appallingThe person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport \xe2\x80\x9cmust be wrong\xe2\x80\x9dHe then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer servicesin Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing toThe voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing securitynone of the shops would accept itWhat let BA down was the food, it really was not nice, the IFE could do with some more content but that\'s not really a huge issue.Lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologizedEdinburgh to London on Feb 14th, 2023, our original flight was cancelled, and the rebooked one was cancelled as well, the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at 12:50and had several delays until 2:24Then we had to wait 57 minutes for our luggage to arrive.Boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flightBoth Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggageUnfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to MadridWe went back to the lady and explained that we couldn\'t wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anythingOur experience was poor from beginning to endAlthough we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problemWhen I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problemThe hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasksWas that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran outIt\xe2\x80\x99s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinderWeighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.However, the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wineFar inferior to what BA used to offerOverall, this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money.Very disappointingMy return flight at 6pm on 28/1/23 was cancelled, replaced by a flight at 9pmIt took off 1/2 hour late meaning I arrived at Gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connectionsI had to pay \xc2\xa370 for a taxi homeNo more BA for meThey are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deterioratedBreakfast after a good night\'s sleep- fruits etc first, couldn\'t manage the full English which was offeredThis flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my lifeI will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happenWhat surprised me was the lack of attention to passengersThe flight was delayed by almost 3 hoursEven though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding hadFirstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use itWhen I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross checkMeantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board\xc2\xa0 I received no apology or compensation from the company at allIt was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.It seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlinesI cannot even check in because BA requires the submission of documents for Covid restrictionsHowever the form to start the submission process is hopelessly brokenAfter clicking "submit" the form just hangs foreverAll have the same hangWhich means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seatHowever, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have hadThere seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top ofthis delayWhen requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need toThe total cost of my booking was \xc2\xa3394.64, which comes to \xc2\xa3197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchaseand there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).Unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed usWe both found the new seat design harder to sleep in.But the two ladies on the desk were like noNo empathy there at all-saying the other guy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me and they will have a word with him ? Come on BA I booked the flight through you,I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customersThere was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - IAlthough combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruinedHeadrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortableThe leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finishAircraft was tiredRubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toiletsToilet seats old, stainedRubber on arm rest was hanging offWas poorKids meal was just as sad Very very poorMix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BAin my opinion, is terribleThis flight was so disappointingDespite being not very old, the A380 looked tired insideBroken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFEPoor in taste and qualitySlight issue during the snack mealOverall, BA just seems a tad cheap these daysGreat to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment endedJust seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.\r\nThe plane was cold, we were shivering, they gave light blankets but they were not enoughLuggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say "call after 72 hours"Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2ndProbably the worst business class experience I\'ve ever had on an airlineThis was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of fourGiven the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my familyRidiculously long boarding times on even small aircraftOn my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departureThere was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding timesSevere overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at HeathrowBoarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extremeOnline check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely brokenOn the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over sixBA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowdedOnboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business classTerrible, one might sayOn the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at allThere was no coffee or tea service after mealsFood quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a "ploughman\'s lunch" being downright disgustingI won\'t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seatingThe seats are not 6\' 2" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6\' 2" heightThe "Priority" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.Definitely not recommended, especially for business classThe seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flightI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudelyYour seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage spaceI\xe2\x80\x99ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 monthsNever again unless there is no other choiceWhen compared with BA long haul that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always get the best of comments at timesI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add onCurrently they have an on line sky cafe but it\xe2\x80\x99s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips.I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviewsIFE didn\xe2\x80\x99t work but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that interesting anywayCabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them downSome cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I thinkSumming up well I am still not coming back to BA not yetfor having to pay to reserve a specific seat - an antiquated ideaThe lack of space in the seating area, small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointingHaving to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive.At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agentsees? Took about 5 minutes to resolveShame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queueIFE system is good but selection mediocreWorst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed inThrough passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flightScore before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10With the luggage fiasco I can\'t rate it more than 4/10.BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from "upcoming flights" on the day of departure)Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were downChaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengersDisappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrivesCheese ice cold and tasteless (why can\'t the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?)Disappointing breakfastSo sad what\'s become of BA.Absolutely terrible experience with British AirwaysAfter a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn\'t get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their teamWhile the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them inThe representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refundWe called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lostThe next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situationWe never heard back from the managerAs we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN \xe2\x80\x94 LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver)We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this changeAdditionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee toWe were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possibleWe were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (forIt has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completelyWe then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation feeWe felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customersWe did not feel taken care of at allWe had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselvesAfter all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.Another BA ShamblesWe get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all nightI ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread rollI just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat itSo basically my husband and I have spent \xc2\xa320,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starvingAs always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots.BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19thHowever, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions toI got nowhere near before the conditions became too badIf they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closedI am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sinsBA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car wasI didn\'t want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that timeI still have had no news on a refund of the \xe2\x82\xac500 2 months onIt\'s such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experienceBA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we\'ve booked this yearWe are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service.Long queues at security due to only 4 lines openPeople stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loadedMissed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next oneArrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive with meFiled a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offerI now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I will be reimbursedBeware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missingI will personally avoid BA in future at all costs.Why have numbered boarding groups if you don\xe2\x80\x99t use themCabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the planeNo acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them pastand she said she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that! Food \xe2\x80\x93 Some of it was inedibleVegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat itToilets \xe2\x80\x93 There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ sectionWe will not be looking to fly BA over Virgin in future.Missing baggage customer service was the worst I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever experiencedI understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flightreported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was receivedBritish Airways are not the flag carrier they used to beThe check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall serviceThe flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday eveningThe boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gateThe cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business classShe kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there.Stupidly tried BA again after a five year gap and paid over \xc2\xa37000 for my wife and I to go to Barbados because I thought the new Business Class layoutSure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs.Seat horribly narrow; 3-4-3 on a 777Glasgow to London delayed by 1 hourMy wife and I now accept that a BA flight will be late and delayedThere\xe2\x80\x99s a high risk of delaysIf you are connecting with another airline with OneWorld it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely risky.I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn\'t allow me to choose seats or to check inThe check-in agent was helpful but couldn\'t fix and suggested we try the BA desk airsideBoarding at LHR T5 was a total chaosOnboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet)Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serveConstantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet)I don\xc2\xb4t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to youWhy would we bother serving you also a sconeHardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between theIn reality - the service could not get any worseDisappointing again especially on businessThe service is ancient, one world lounges are a catastrophe at HeathrowBusiness class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard.During both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent mealWhat outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldn\'t even order any food / drink because the card reader didn\'t functionInitially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hoursAs such I knew I would miss my connection in WarsawThe Denver to Heathrow flight was terribleThe plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availabilityThe plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not goodMy food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerableWhen i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circusPassengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connectionsNot only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connectionsMy bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to MiamiBA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I canI mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting myExtremely sub-par serviceStaff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changedLast meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flightPlates were literally grabbed awayI had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on meNone of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before mealBecause the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping offI virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlinesBritish Airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn\'t let me check-in until 24 hours before the flightI have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak withCustomer service had such a thick accent I didn\'t think they were speaking English.The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment systemSo we couldn\'t even get a warm cup of coffee or teasIt is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a reviewWill honestly never fly them again if I can help it.This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airlineI had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow AirportI am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affectedWhen I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11thSince then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issueI emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until todayI contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waitingThe only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they\'re not even getting back to meEvery time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some moreI have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yetThis whole experience was a hassleVery unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA.Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket- But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destinationBags also tagged incorrectly and had disappearedTurns out this was false information ..But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out-Arrived late to the gate (train not working)Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not workingI was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink)Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this conditionFood averageHow embarrassing for BA.Worst experience everOutbound flight was cancelled and I was not notifiedI was rebooked on a very uncomfortable tripInbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notifiedOn top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only bag I hadFood is horrible.Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flightThe aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horribleOverall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screensThe meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this timeat a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experienceOverall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey.Beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to BABA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructedDisgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we\'ve lostIt\'s 4 months later and British Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter.I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I can\'t get my entry visa in time for theSo I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person\'s flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks,I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you tryI tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penaltyBased on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put inGiven all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways.I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection pricesThe A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route mapThe staff disappeared for most of the flightThe flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience.I\xe2\x80\x99ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I\xe2\x80\x99m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you canWe should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you\xe2\x80\x99ve then got an 8hr + flighthad been delayedThey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it out and away quickly enoughThey were all extremely miserable and clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be on boardWe\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami inThis was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival.These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at allThere is no entertainment, no magazineThere is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do thisRecline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezedOn the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA\xe2\x80\x99s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late inthe evening and some passengers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t travel at all because there were not enough crewAltogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because itFood was fine but not outstandingBaby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even restMentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at allMy second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried somethingBaggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been deliveredA380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not whatCheck in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don\'t work well and staff have to be calledBoarding was very poorly managedThe ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengersThe gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraftThe flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issueThe woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the timeShouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about herOnce we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was brokenThe recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm restI asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact thatI was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn\'t reclineI eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also brokenAttitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendousSo, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British AirwaysI asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don\'t do refundsI paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can\'t refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emailsto the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in thatAll they have now offered me is a \xc2\xa350 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn\'t payed for theseats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a \xc2\xa350 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that wasbrokenAfter all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them againVery rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a nationalWhile entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocatingOther then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response.However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife)And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screenRefused to pay BA\'s extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats togetherFew technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flightWhen unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainmentFirst ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won\'t ever be my first choiceWas seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very crampedWhen the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat backThe seat itself wasn\'t too bad but I felt squished and locked inDinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snackWhat a mess that place is.Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHRDisappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated togetherThere is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flightMeal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not asAlso, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business classArrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea whenMeal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at onceMy 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flightUpon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days laterThey did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conferenceHowever, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I \xe2\x80\x9cchanged my flight a 2nd time\xe2\x80\x9dI find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination inI have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I\xe2\x80\x99m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel toIf I have a choice, I will never travel BA againSuch awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs.Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault anythingMy flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there\xe2\x80\xa6 the lady at theI bolted again into the plane feeling bad that I did not personally thank her for her magicGood flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39J and lack of good leg roomMy neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.Flight was 1 hour late leaving gate No pillows, no blanket, horrible inflight service, staff were harassing meBritish Airways is probably the worst air company I have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hourThe staff were no help and frankly rude.Flight was cancelled at the last minute due to \xe2\x80\x9cweather\xe2\x80\x9d despite pretty much all other flights not being affectedHorrendous check-in and security delays meant we almost missed the new flightWhoever brought in this change of food supplier ..The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports.Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a feeI call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book anew flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wantHowever to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future thatSo they now have my money and I have to re-book at full costIn the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up.I will never fly BA againThey cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offeredThe food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for theI will not be flying BA againOur flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th March was cancelled with 3 hours\xe2\x80\x99 noticeWe still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-upsIt is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking upYou can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered isUneventful flightthe Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid testIf one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelledI was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floorThere was no help at there to find a hotelI have MS and can\'t walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothingI lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music courseBA insist it\'s not their fault it\'s the hotels for closingI would not have got on the plane had I knownBA now say they will withdraw the \'offer\' of expenses if I doTheir policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enoughFor someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled PassengersSo for people with disabilities it\'s just not worth the risk of travelling with BA.British Airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with 3 stopsAfter I complained, they changed the dateWhen I told them the date would not work, they attempted to charge me additional $5,000 for the changeI submitted a complaint and have not heard anything If you try to reach out, no chance.Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NYShocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 yearsMy grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignoredLast one was told "wait till drinks are served!" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothingOnly issue was with indifferent/non-helpful BA call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advanceHolidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn\'t take our cabin suitcases withAt our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days agoand we still don\'t have the suitcase or any information about itToday I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn\'t allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing,2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they\'ve ruined my holidaysNo compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more liesDespite BA\'s promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website I have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the ChiefExecutive) have remained unansweredDo not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promisesSome things just do not change at BA.Refund process is non responsive I have been following up on my refund since October, 2021 which is 9 months nowBritish Airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked onTill today I have not received my refundCustomer service is non-existentFor over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeksWhen BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister\'s ticket, not once but twiceIt took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called backWhere is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stressBritish Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinionWords simply don\'t convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the companyOn time arrival, baggage quite slowHowever there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who wasThey also managed to lose my luggageI will never use them again.When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flightWhen we got to Security Check area the line was massively longWe questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the othersYet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the \xe2\x80\x9cflight connections\xe2\x80\x9dwe were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of \xe2\x80\x9cthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough time,\xe2\x80\x9d that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flightrebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrsI was not told or assured I\xe2\x80\x99d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BAThis ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK.Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hoursBecause of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to rescheduleAfter 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eatThis meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands(hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flightSeems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yetapart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight.uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flightCabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn\'t sleep even if the seats were comfortableThis was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding proceduresWhy are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as peopleAnd to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded lastThe small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what AirNothing specialDeparture five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delayOver 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for Covid the day beforeSince then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation)As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portraysWith a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare.Flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking downLuggage never made it to Toronto and we filed a lost baggage reportAs it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run outThe club kitchen ran out of food quite quicklyIt was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a resultOur flight was unexpectedly cancelledWe were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc)When we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a showWe tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help usNo one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of moneyWe are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!British Airways has given me such grief, trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away, they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after theyI call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situationI will never book with BA againSure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted timeAnd to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easierBIG MISTAKEAfter that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloomWe waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband\'s nor mine cameThen, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bagsAt this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I\'ve had bags not get on flights beforeBA doesn\'t seem to have anything like thisIn this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bagI hadn\'t flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again.British Airways is poorly staffed at Venice airportNo one to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 1.5 hours beforeLimited TV and movie selections, wifi did not workWhen I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn\'t happy with theI called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer milesI read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable.The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seatAudio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watchThe cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganisedFelt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraftThe overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flightNice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hoursI am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to theWas going from Belfast to London but they cancelled the flight, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know it was cancelledthe refund takes agesOverall not happy at all.Second time getting poor service from BA1st, unable to contact via phone, email or website2nd even with four business class tickets across the Atlantic, they do not allow free seat selection or check in until 24 hours prior to the flightOf course no-one at the airport could do anything.Trip was cancelled due to Covid lockdownsWe asked BA staff for refund, told cannot do but will issue vouchersWe stated no good for two elderly people from Australia as would not know when we can travelInformed no other option and silly vouchers sentNow they are running out of date and unusable! Have been asking for two years for refund! Many many emailsReally not fair to just take our money!We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the planeWe arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDGAt LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flightback to MIA since I did not take my flightTrying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the persondid not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle \xe2\x80\x9cflight only\xe2\x80\x9d problems feeding us back to the number we just called andwe\xe2\x80\x99re unable to be helpedThey under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates - don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled.The flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route, finally I lost my luggage andI will never again travel with British Airways.Terrible experience with British Airways! I was obligated to check-in my carry-on suitcase due to my group number, according to the girl at the front deskNow, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase isAlways the promise that the bag will be delivered today, but it never happens! No respect with the customer! First and last time with British Airways for sure! I don\'tBA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn\'t book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guaranteesThey cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn\'t find a flight up to and including OctoberI was refunded about 1/5 of what I paidI called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn\'t fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn\'t get a fullEach phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer serviceAnd thats where the frustration beginsThe customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the caseA month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 ofIt would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustratedand give upjust for an answer as to why I wasn\'t getting a full refundI didn\'t cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HKAfter another month of waiting ..We\'re sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022Your claim\'s been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reasonThe cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our scheduleI don\'t know what "non payable commercial reason" isI am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company.for \xe2\x80\x9curgent cases\xe2\x80\x9d, which ever number I dial, I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to speak to any one till 0757Again, I was told that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore AirlinesThe customer service of British Airways is really badYou can\'t reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 minsNot only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low qualityOverall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with themSeat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine canYou pay extra for absolutely nothing.The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decadeIt was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficultThe in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and musicThe food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poorI don\'t know what the business class offerings from BA\'s rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines onAs a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling ofdelaysStaff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crewBA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 yearsNo printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customersIt appears there is no supply control in place at BAStaff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin.\xc2\xa0I end where I started, BA\xc2\xa0standards continue to slip.\xc2\xa0Right now do not use British AirwaysWhen booking, person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination, but he was wrongFlight to London was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh, and had to wait 9 hours for the next flightComing back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on soOnce back in Boston luggage did not show upThey said we would get it within 24 hours and we didn\'t, so far it will be at least 2 days.I could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doingHowever, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upsetThe company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husbandI did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet\xe2\x80\x99s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone)I will never use this company again nor will anyone that I am close toThis has been completely dishearteningPlease please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any informationI have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before.Flight was delayed arriving at Vancouver from London, which meant that departing flight from Vancouver was also delayedPassengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are "very busy right now"and our baggage will arrive "soon." Onboard amenities and services quite disappointingSeat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back supportCabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flightOverall, a fairly disappointing experience with BA.Pushback delayed by lack of tugArrival more or less on time, but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridgeLong queue to get through immigration.Covid form is broken - Called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone1 hour flight delay - was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as mostI explained that I really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as I have 3 hours drive left after I arrive at the airportIn short: totally not customer friendlyWill try to avoid flying next time with BA.However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flightAs I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor proceduresFood was forgettableNot fun on a night flight with turbulenceCheck-in queue at Cancun took foreverCouldn\'t see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gateI continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternativeDespite a 4 hour layover in Heathrow, bags didn\'t make it onto the connecting flightOnce in Hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employeeA group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to noFour days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer serviceAbsolutely miserable customer supportOur flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly BA again.Worst airline experience everCheck in was a disasterThe connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infantThe ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours lateThen they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don\'t have our luggageCalling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyoneThis airline is a complete disaster, please do not fly them.Even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at Vancouver, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matterMy son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines.Unfortunately, people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negativelyThe flight was very expensive though as we booked late, after being dumped by Air Canada / Swiss air, after they cancelled their flight at the last moment.As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company\xe2\x80\x99s recent drop in standardsWhen we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly includedWe were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to payWe have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closedI tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered to respondHowever they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake.Boarding on time, but unfortunately from ORT\xe2\x80\x99s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond BA\xe2\x80\x99s controlCrew were good but lacked the personal touchOld style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it\xe2\x80\x99s ageThe cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointingFlight delays can happen, but the way BA handles such incidents in just way beyondOur flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hoursRechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in lineA rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counterWill certainly never fly BA again and do not recommend this airline.Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passengerin front reclines its even worseFood is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wineThe connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with noThe outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relativesOverall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again.Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamedBack in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelledI had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such anI have now also asked for my Executive Club account to be closed as I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airlineWe arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to BA was terribleThe airport security lines were not managed wellIt was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experiencedAll the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experienceAmsterdam is the worst airport I have experienced.That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative8 hours after booking, I need to change my flightI assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lieOf course, calling them does nothingThe hotline says that they are too busyThis happens again and againThis time the voucher code doesn\'t work on the website when I enter itSo here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucherI have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019..The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelledI asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn\'t have access to that informationBA have acknowledged they owe me a refundThe refund never cameI have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no responseHonestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airlineI suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now.When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get itissued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutesThey would not let me board, and I missed the flightSo I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled andUnfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the InsuranceEvery time I fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them again.Another dreadful mediocre experience with BA to MalagaThen on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn\xe2\x80\x99t order food or drinksThen the card payment system didn\xe2\x80\x99t work so we gave up on orderingFinally at Malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case \'we\' caused the plane to gounbalanced? Really? It\xe2\x80\x99s all one excuse after another with BA these days.Cancelled connection flight: confusing UI, still shows cancelled booking in my bookings, never sent a confirmation email for new flights Cant check-inCustomer service is non-existentBusy line, after 45min still no one there to help me check in.Very low standards for Club Europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected, aircraft not properly cleaned in Athens(there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket)No in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from European routes which is a shameBritish Airways continues to decline in customer serviceI used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchersThe most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the companyEven as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phoneAt this rate, they have lost my trust.As I\xe2\x80\x99m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has beenI spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriateOn Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up respondingThey just left my message unreadI continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the bookingI\xe2\x80\x99m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues againI\xe2\x80\x99m extremely frustrated.Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toiletIf my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator musicand an insincere guarantee that my call matteredSometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anythingOther times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plightIF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after "needing" to put me on hold once more to "speak withtheir supervisor." In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle.Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were ineconomy right at the back we got the "leftovers", my entertainment system was also not workingWe are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrificI had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn\'t realise until we checked inI ended up having to pay an additional \xc2\xa385 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possibleand I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luckWe asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help meCompared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect.I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hoursI connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class serviceWhy, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethicsI have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lostall patience with this airlineHaving paid almost \xc2\xa31K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flightThere was no option to get any of the other available flightsThe business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to moveThe aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floorThe seats were uncomfortableThe poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure.hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number whichwas read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have nointention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.Our Good Friday flight was delayed by 5hours, STD 12.50 ATD 18.00 TO Durban, South Africa from JohannesburgThere were no announcements made, when approached no time frame was given, they simply didn\'t knowThe aircraft was filthyWe shall never fly Comair again that includes Kulula or BA absolutely shocking service.All 4 flights were delayedThe worst with 2h15minAlso one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacationNo explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delaysThis was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.I doubt if this can be betteredI had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022Zero empathy towards me a struggling customerSecond situation happened when we arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had toThis has been an appalling experience.has been cancelledNot sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originallyThere was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flightgiven it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British AirwaysThey also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closedI have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again.The only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn\'t good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and TV showsTotal chaos for departures immigration at Malaga AirportFood can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class mealsMenu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroducedpoorThe WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flightBA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.\r\nI am constantly amazed how British Airways continue to get things wrong - I pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years livingin the UK, I have watched their decline with great sadnessNot only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waitedAs they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought itwas good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight toAs it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attendNever again.At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business classAs we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the "Points game" but I take exception to having paid infull on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seatsThe points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to usOn the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacantI think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like thisIn summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.Wifi was annoying, cutting off and needing constant reconnectingBritish Airways is the most terrible airline I\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt withThey have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can\xe2\x80\x99t make the changes onlineThey hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customersYou can\xe2\x80\x99t check in online, the application sucks so much you\xe2\x80\x99re better off trying to code your own app and it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably work better, every time you try to checkwon\xe2\x80\x99t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return I hope I never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with British Airways ever again.British Airways is the most terrible airline I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever dealt withThey have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can\xe2\x80\x99t make the changes onlineThey hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customersI have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we\xe2\x80\x99d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airlineand would have been alone in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers.Ran out of a lot and options left were not goodBA continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service, provided by people who shouldn\'t be in customer service, on tired, dirty and cramped aircraftOut of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-timeIncluding having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BAcancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US.A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can\'t come soon enoughEven tried to pay BA\'s extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks aheadMy wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and FThe March film selection so not goodNot particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA\'s policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ieSort it out BADinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly direMy wife\'s smoked salmon bagel was dreadfulAs usual when BA is good, it\'s really good but when it\'s bad it\'s awfulWe pay a lot for "premium" seats.The worst budget airline I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they\xe2\x80\x99re basically freeBA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst serviceSpent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashedThey left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have hadto refund everyone\xe2\x80\x99s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arriveIt took three days to return it and cost us \xc2\xa3100sThen on return I\xe2\x80\x99ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there\xe2\x80\x99s no sign of our luggage againI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how a company can be this incompetent but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be pursuing for compensationI have some free flights from Amex but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be using them because it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth going through this again.The infrastructure however is appallingZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this outLHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staffEven when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort outtheir stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airlineHave not flown economy with BA for years, what a shock! Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainmentFood and service appallingAnd no antibacterial wipes offeredWi-Fi advertised but not available on flightOnce again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment systemOnly one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seatCome on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for theVery poor flight from Cape Town to LondonAfter the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived atThe captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would meanour arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the groundThen the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite periodThe food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more soThe cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutneyNo top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served sinceCome on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routesTime was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case.Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the pastNo snacks were offered during the flightWe certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again.Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet againSurely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayedUpdated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadaysAs Emerald OneWorld, I wish there was an alternative because BA has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since BEA/BOAC days.we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggageAfter that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hoursWhen trying to go through customs they wouldn\'t let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutesThey told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hourWe then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hourthem losing our bags), excursions and transportationDue to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extraWithin a few days, it\'s declinedWe have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declinedWe tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messagesThey refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I hadto buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buyThere is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from.The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrivedWe suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BAFrustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airlineThe drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergyBaggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t check in onlineWe arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check inThen several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely movingThe whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hoursAnd completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happenedI think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I\xe2\x80\x99d previously been told,Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have movedA staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t wantWe were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.Absolutely bad experience with " British Airways." I have two bookings with them for the past two yearsboth were cancelledMy flight to Antalya in May 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is givenI will definitely not book ever again with them.Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointingSafety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS routeAUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late tooFood quality on both legs was not fit for human consumptionIn flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not workingCheck in at AUS was rottenWhat was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail readyHaving looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth itIf I had the option of another airline - I would not fly BA.The food was awfulAn over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thingTerribleThen went to a Traditional Breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash brown\'sSuch rubbish on BA.I really can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they have the audacity to call this First ClassThe check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpfulThe official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they\xe2\x80\x99re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go inSuffice to say it was not pleasantOnboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketchI can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class trainingNeither had any knowledge of the wines on the menuMost of the food was awfulMy steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap\xc3\xa9 of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sackedHowever the worst thing was the constant galley noiseThere was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slammingBut disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7amMovies are all outdated and already watchedI swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flightReceived a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelledThe staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BAHa Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHRBy 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly becauseBA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airsideBoarded flight 45mins lateThe staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation -The aircraft are cramped and wornHow on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline.We will never use BA again for a long haul flightWe weren\xe2\x80\x99t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flightI think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/FirstActually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classesThey ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it\xe2\x80\x99s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had noBA just don\xe2\x80\x99t care anymore about the little people.British Airways is getting worse an worse, my flight was 8 mins lateLuggage is taking hours to arrive No communication whatsoever from anyoneThey can\'t be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails, if they doMy app is crashing most of the timesThey change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do.Got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business classCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even provide compensation or a refundUnacceptableNever again.Absolutely shambolic customer serviceThe lounges at Heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible, waited over an hour for my chosen food/drink order to be brought to meEnded up getting it myself and told off for doing soOur flight back to Athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight homeI understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airlineWhat\'s worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found,causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculouslyexpensive last minute ticketsThe absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with, and I will never be flying with them again.Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airportNo airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptableWhilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flightIt was a struggle to get my connecting flightOn arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flightThere was a mistake on my booking made by BATook over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolvedAbsolutely the most shambolic customer support I have ever experiencedStill waiting for the call back I was promised 2 weeks ago.Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43it\'s an embarrassmentThe tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond beliefThis does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it\'s a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA\'s competitors and smacks of continued cost-cuttingQueues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them cleanArrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage.British Airways continues to go downhillWe were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day beforeThe food was dreadfulThe in flight service was unsophisticatedThey don\xe2\x80\x99t any moreBA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugsCOVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful.British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard\xc2\xa0flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remainsCabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staffI guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules?\xc2\xa0For once more BA got it all wrong with 6 hours delay, food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or adviceNo staff to serve the waiting passengersAnother episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer serviceThe fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasonswas pitifulYou could not rebook via BA\xe2\x80\x99s websiteSome BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace.Very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economyCheck in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellersSpecial meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignoredI spoke to a BA customer service representative as soon as I landed in Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said theHave been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints websiteTelephone hotline is now also currently unavailable.A full business class ticket and a fee for seat? A very disengaged management model.Appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive bookingHours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can\'t take the call)They don\'t respond to emails sent to the complaints line.This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, myOur initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minuteUnfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departureBA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day laterDinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choiceBoarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gateWhether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multipleHowever, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedibleThe new seats don\'t significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there\'s an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spineProgress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasonsUnfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old planeThe bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and post iPad era just don\xe2\x80\x99t live upThe food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at onceApparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staffI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels.Utterly appalling companyWe\'ve flown with them two times now, and both times it\'s been a disasterThe first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hoursEventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letterWhen we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn\'t choose our roomsWe were given a terrible, dirty, cramped roomMy tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn\'t get a mealNo compensation was offeredThe second time I need to reschedule my flightIf you need to phone BA, don\'t even bother tryingI never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than reschedulingThe food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequentlyMy sandwich was inedibleOver the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London HeathrowWhile the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are uselessFirst time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines faultHowever the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a jokeThey had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get throughTheir was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shopSince the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane fortaken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a latercomplaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaintsA few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up onlyto find the complaints staff were not workingI got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistencyOur outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointingCheck in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bagbeen clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flightIn fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be lateThe food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standardsWith the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wineLunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requestedOverall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crewI was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very longI stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flightI personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunatelyFrom shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeysThe trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flightBeing a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turnNeedless to say it never didSo I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame onyou British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengersStop your lying or update your promises!I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par serviceI understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough two years for airlines but BA\xe2\x80\x99s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummetedEnormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they\xe2\x80\x99d miss their flightsTerrible efficiency at the check-in countersThe interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating areaThey give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding areaThere are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionallyOn this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pulling his weightVery poorI used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m clinging on to my airline status which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually provide you a better service theseTwo of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t workThe plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium tempOn to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering evenHad to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at allMenu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffinsI asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hourAsked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t, with no apologies or even tryingNothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well usedIt was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticketNaive to trust claims of world class standards.Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appallingIt took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue)The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kidsLady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was uselessHuge queue with no business check inGetting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting offBreakfast was a very tired looking croissantNot very keen on the new table servicePoor choice and miniscule portionsThe flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 minsNo drinks or anything offered while we waitedFood was not even worth mentioningAs far as Club Europe goes it\'s not worth the extra costThe first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was rightPisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughableFood was an antipasto of some sort which I declinedClub Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabinI would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flatThe food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn\'t dragged outCabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toiletsThey bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I\'d be issued a refundInstead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally emailThey told me I\'d be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgradeWhen I emailed again saying that that doesn\'t add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with "That\'s the final amount." Turns outthat meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 totalSo I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me.sweat in a queue when the gate is not even theretoo complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box)One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines insteadIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold statusThe boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at allThey called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and thelegroom was appallingThe entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones inputwas as good as uselessFlying during covid is always a challengeI had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worseT5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving lateCheck in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etcBA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all roundBoarding was chaos and we left an hour lateBA hang your head in shame.Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappearedHeathrow was a nightmare as often happensBeing 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times.been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weatherAirport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we thenhad to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I hadThat did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could notBA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they hadYou cannot see outhas to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage spaceMy wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behindThe reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at allThis is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible.I claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of August, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providingI have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn\'t get a replyIt has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answerFurthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptionsBritish Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasonsWe had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flightsBA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may notMy second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancelwill be more expensiveIt is a very big inconvenience for me and I don\'t even get an apology, just cancel!How wrong I wasThis was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak timesHowever, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration feesThey had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flightThe call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (includingA week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothingOnce again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flightThus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning overThe next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add onThe whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold musicFurthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flightThough I\'ve flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.Extremely disappointed In trip experienceI could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustratingThe Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection processWho does that without notifying the customerI found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not validI had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue wasThen i had to go to Delta to sort the mess outI am so frustrated.British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of CovidIt is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline howBA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environmentI was refused an early check in and was told to come back at 2:30pm for a 5.05pm departureThere was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger.The flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the M25Not the airlines faultThe crew failed to work as a teamNot BA\'s finest hour.Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things downNot sure whyCheck-in very slowNo app check-in and could not check my vaccine QR code onlineSeats close together and row 30 even worseArrival at Heathrow a total shamblesBA777 landed at 12.50, no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutesThen BA jetty didn\xe2\x80\x99t workThen BA had no stepsVery slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the stepsEveryone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watchSo BA skimping on lounge, plane condition and gateAfter 1h queuing at the check-in desk, I am told that my booked seat is not availableWhy do you sell seats that you do not have?The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if BA could not get a better one! On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority,Dreadful - not for us again.Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out aHowever, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliersDid not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre bookingNot a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queueAlso not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two3 hours standing in line for boarding passAirline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronicallyThen they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flightMy flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutesThey are so unorganized and slow! Getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlinesYou have to wait even though I paid for itAvoid this airline at all costs! Absolute worst!I cant change online because I\'m flying out of another city so the service is unavailable onlineI\'ve tried live chat several times and waited 2.5 hours only to be told there\'s no one available (during business hours)I have tried calling and the line always drops from their endCustomer service is non existentHowever, of course if you call the "new booking" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can\'t help me nor put me through to anyone apparentlyShambolic excuse of an airline that doesn\'t deserve to be a national airlineI haven\'t had these problems at all and I\'ve been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately)This whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shamblesDrop down menu to drop down menu not stating what I wanted to complain aboutWould not even allow me to add tier pointsThe flight to London was marred with problemsThis never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the emailThe resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staffThe return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at Manchester completely exhausted and needing another holidayPoorly mismanaged services this timeDisappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters, had to wait around 1.5 hours just to check inThen came the boarding, again had to wait at the passage for 15-30 minsFinally when we thought things are better now, on reaching London our next boarding pass was not scannedAround 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from 7.45 am until 1.40 am for the next flightJourney was really hectic and did not expect this from BA.Currently dreading my flight with BA considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so calledAll we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for meAbsolutely impossibleTheir website is unusableTheir customer service is a shamblesThey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change the nameWell you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have these people making mistakesAnyways not the pointThe woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t making it clear on what to do50 minutes and got nothingIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long sector and the food wasn\xe2\x80\x99t greatDrinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I\xe2\x80\x99m being honest when we\xe2\x80\x99ve paid a lot of money for itThe seats are not so comfortableUpon checking in at the Club desk in Lisbon airport our Passenger Locator Forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our Day 2 test and the checkin agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the U.K., much distressas the baggage taking agesAlso the seat recline on G-GATL (9f) is broken.I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraftVery cramped seating and uncomfortableThe armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for oneAisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkwardI have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it\xe2\x80\x99s not for meWhat has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80\xe2\x80\x99s and now make passengers physically queue to manuallycheck in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queueOn the premise it\xe2\x80\x99s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can\xe2\x80\x99t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers theyhad two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point wherethey\xe2\x80\x99re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgraceIn the last year I\xe2\x80\x99ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planningthe itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one toSt Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeksThat cost me my \xc2\xa32500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparentlyto mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking reallybad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that nothey won\xe2\x80\x99t extend the voucher! I\xe2\x80\x99m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even goingto bother using my second voucher and I\xe2\x80\x99ve cancelled my BA Amexmost ridiculedWho\xe2\x80\x99d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option.To begin with , I had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat There was no hand soap in the washroomHowever, it was not the same on my return flight.which had less comfortable seats that didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11)This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-sellingHad I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight,I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have bookedI complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that wayI also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed offApparently this is a long running scam, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they get away with it.Terrible customer serviceCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go, still can\xe2\x80\x99t go as borders are still closedI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t given an option just told I have to take a voucherNow I have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although I booked for a flight for Cayman and I stillhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to goThey cannot provide the service I paid for and refuse to refund meThey are not sympathetic or understandingCheck-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etcBut on the return flight, it was a total messThere were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each otherIt took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delayOn board, I was not expecting great service Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flightaircraft is was still taxing to the gateCE stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggledOn arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistakeI offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister\'s name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us homeI never received these flight vouchersI have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to meThey have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a \'no show\' which is inaccurateI have had no response to my emails/messagesSo ludicrous as I did not take her name and I doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of BA customers a day.We have flown with BA for many years and never will again where there is an alternativeDidn\'t receive a meal or drinks onboard, crew were so unorganisedWe were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in-flight service was delayed once up in theThey commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned it and closed the service altogetherThe crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoyComplained to BA and received an apology by email with the usual "we fell short of our standards" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or Avios tocompensate for the lack of service.But the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect adviceSky Cafe still not on sale - not quite sure why given COVID protocols in the UK are mainly relaxed nowAll have either been cancelled or had a significant time changeThe latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we\xe2\x80\x99d scheduled around 2 hours between flightsBA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most partThey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival timeA complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so farPerhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the momentIt\xe2\x80\x99s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.The service is got super inconsistent on BA and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathyThe crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fairWe got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malagano room serviceI have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast.Such terrible service in Club WorldSuch indifference and lackadaisical attitudeHardly any serviceSeriously BA...what are you doing? Is this how you welcome back people to fly?Galleries Lounge chock-a-block first thing on a Wednesday morning and T5 seemed as bustling as pre-pandemicPost-COVID lunch remains restricted - Do&Co must be horrified by what they\'re having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish I\'ve ever tastedWi-Fi access wasn\'t free for business class passengers: \xc2\xa34.99 for an hour of intermittent service is excessivestaff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraftWhat a contrast to the Iberia crew (Lisbon/Madrid/London) who were cold and unprofessional.Never experienced this beforeThe LHR-GRU flight was cancelled without any explanationI contacted both Edreams and BA a number of times in the last 14 months but they did not refund the 461 Euros that I paid.Stranded in the lounge because I wasn\'t allocated a seatI didn\'t want to use them but was forced to because Emirates wasn\'t availableI think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 "travel flexibility" really means, because it doesn\'t pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business classI tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their websiteThe recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says "therefore we can\'t answer your call;try again." No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etcFor whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt letI called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York linesTwo days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight toI\'ve now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get throughFinally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothingThe fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothingOr that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-bookedI am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the planeWe were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delayBecause of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to TiranaTurning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer serviceIt shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid forI am very disappointed by this experience.Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worseWe just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport duringTheir website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that noa COVID test to show negative resultsThey charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessaryFood service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies)BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this onlineWe have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around.However their service seems to have gone hugely downhillFlights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possibleYou cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someoneIf they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptlyI was stunned by the recent cancellation to my Catania flight two weeks before I was due to travel.The entertainment system was working badly, the screen was freezing every time I wanted to open flight mapAfter flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of waterI think it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like thisOn top of that, we landed at terminal 5,and I had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own, holdingI met no one whom I can ask for a help No further assistance or helpI had to wait another hour for luggage and pramI am absolutely frustrated, upset and disappointed! I can see that British Airways do not care about mothers with kids at all. Very unhappy passengers - and when confronted the BA transport manager\'s response was "sorry - we are still learning"Shame - since lounge service was very goodTo me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event.BA encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check-in, this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want this, they want to see the actualforms tests etc! This wasted about 40 minutes and is pointlessThey cancelled a flight I booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roofBritish Airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher.Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrivedI would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not\xe2\x80\xa6 *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs aI had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin Englishwas due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD againNeedless to say I was furiousI complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travelSo BA\xe2\x80\x99s covid excuse rang somewhat hollowlost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfersGiven the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderablesum of money, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to avoid BA from now on.Given water bottle before take off, no welcome drinkNow COVID rules are being relaxed this needs to changeLooks like some of White Company bedding options removedClub world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage!work and school that wasn\'t ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeksWe rebooked the flight- as suggested by them and a week later BA cancelled the rebooked flightI was informed that they can\'t give a time frame for processing refunds, and no refund issued yetBA representative refuses to give contact details to the manager, they cut the phone.The airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in London, and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layoverThey denied my ask, no explanations and no empathyNot only that, but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalationAgain, not the change in schedule, not the extra 5 hours layover timeJust the way they chose to treat a customer who didn\'t do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute.Called several times but they couldn\'t do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together availableWhen we boarded, the whole plane was empty and still they didn\'t allow us to seat together.I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only optionNo other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offeredAt meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn\'t available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seatThe "bed" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hardThe cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warmAll in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the \xc2\xa35,727 that BA charges for this routeI used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA\'s unique and notorious "fuel surcharge" fee of $636 for using miles.Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumablyBoris Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s bully boy attitudeBA cancelled flight in Dec 2020We are now 6 months down the line, 13 calls of which each is 40 min waiting time, and 16 email remindersConclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucherHead of call center is keeping to her empty promises.When snack was distributed my row (#8 business) was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprisedThis was not my best experience with BA thus far as there were a couple of disappointmentsThe COVID protocols are not as robust as they should be, particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entranceThere was a big mix up which I find inexcusable - I and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane, causing a few anxious moments andthe friendly attendant had to get me another seat but I don\'t expect such at this levelOk flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flightI had not been informed before requesting the \xe2\x80\x9cE-voucher\xe2\x80\x9d and I would need to call up to rebook (I\xe2\x80\x99m in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion)So not only was my flight cancelled 3 times I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t offered an option to rebook a new flight online I was inconvenienced every step of the way.Absolutely appalling experienceBritish Airways, unfortunately, has lowered it\'s standards and to my dismay, I\'ve been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than BACustomer service representatives are completely clueless, unprofessional and not bothered I recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff weren\'t interested in helping me return home.The airline didn\xe2\x80\x99t notify me until I learned that I could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when I went for check-inWhen I booked a single ticket from Canada to India, how come they didn\'t realise I couldn\'t fly? No refund at allGave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but I don\'t have any travel plans for the next two yearsThat means my money is gone? When talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was \'Onetravel\'The worst experience ever with an airlineAm a frequent flyer, was trying BA for the first time but now I guess I am never going to fly with youA poor show with BA.My return flight from Antigua to London was cancelled 2 timesWhen I call to BA several times their computer system didn\xe2\x80\x99t work and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t issue new ticket, as the result I had to pay airport price for baggage, asI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay online without ticketWhen I done it, I was asked to submit expenses, but link provided was to lost baggage expenses, not what I claimedThey replied that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t compensate anything.4 cancellations for 1 month! Applying vouchers only to find out they don\'t work after new cancellation! Terrible stammersDo not recommend to anyone in Covid restrictions.She also made sure I had eaten my food and stood by next to me as I was feeling awful because I was in lot of painFirstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2There\'s a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn\'t help with the detailsNot good enough for an expensive ticketThe food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every timeThe first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attentionThe seat would not easily convert to a bedIt had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabbyAgain, not what you\'d expect from a premium productI left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about thisBA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customersBA isn\'t offering it at the momentThe company just don\'t care.Absolutely disgracefulconditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount I received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative.Nothing exceptional but it was only a short flightMy only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before Chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close tojust hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not workValue for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were so expensive! To be expected though, I know.But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get homeI was declined by another companyAfter I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare theFlight was ok - seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my food was grossLots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn\xe2\x80\x99t see themI had a direct flight from London to Lahore and travelling with them was a nightmareThey did not have milk for my son\'s bottle, didn\'t even give warm water for his formula milkYou literally have to beg them for drinks water etc.Staff was so rude and treated us like trashIt\'s not at all child friendlyI will never travel with them again.The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know thatFriendly, professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe BA, while Lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant, impossible to contact and ignorantMy flight was 10 hour journey from London to Bangalore, and I was hungry.The one thing I can complain about is baggage handling at HeathrowWe waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of Club Europe priority.We arrived at the airport at 7:00am, and the queue for check-in was incredibly long because some desks were closedIt took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk, and when we arrived we were told that the check-in had closed (at 7:25am) and that we had missedBritish Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytimeWe have just received a response from the Customer Relations service telling us that we would get nothing.My flight from Los Angeles to Paris via London was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so I missed my connexion in London and arrived inParis 3\'25" late and missed my onward connexion on Air France and had to overnight on my own dime in ParisI applied for compensation lawfully due me through EC261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in London under the 3-hour delay windowThe truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surchargeSo, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight thereI do not know which is more shocking that BA would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know howI was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flightA number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoeverAlso, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with veryAn upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn\'t seem to make senseI was due to fly back to London on 25th August 2020 and my flight got cancelledBut I was told that I am not eligible to get a voucher because I have done the London to Singapore legBut to redeem the voucher I have to call to redeem the voucher (which I think it is a complete joke) and I was put on hold for many hours.British Airways canceled my flight to London on June 3 due to COVID-19It is July 23 and they still have not refunded my moneyNothing has workedThey will not call me and will not provide me any resolutionThey are blatantly ignoring emails asking for helpAvoid British AirwaysService is non-existent and they will keep your moneyThey are keeping almost $3000US of our money.I made the mistake of exchanging my April flights with BA for a voucher, because of the travel disruption due to the pandemicBig mistakeBA has failed completely and does not seem to careI tried to book an August flight using the voucher, but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucherYou have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someoneCustomer service tried to charge me twice the original costThen no email confirmation for hours, after I chased it up (another long wait on hold)Email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date - service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refundA few days later I started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date (still not the one I wanted, but better) - And 3 weeks later, BA cancelled Things go wrongBA hasn\'t a clue!BA cancelled my flight to Lyon, March/April 2020, because of the Corona crisisI could not obtain a refund, as the BA website and telephone service made this impossible, it just sent me round in circlesThe Silver card member phone number is inaccessible, as BA has reduced telephone access to one numberThis is exactly the same message that I received the many times I called for a refundIs BA not honouring their voucher system, trying to fob off customers and keep their money? This is appalling business practice!Total rip offBritish Airways cancels flights due to Pandemic Covid 19British Airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic.With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outsidethe US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we needI asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money Ihaving to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the caseI was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financiallyas much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BAI cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for thisI am at a loss as to what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that Ivalued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refundI will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways.I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in MarchIf I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I wereThe fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with theThe response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is availableI\'m very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them.Covid hit and they cancelled the flightTheir subsequent behaviour, was all their fault! After a mammoth effort to contact them, i was offered a full refundThis took months and many calls to get, and they deducted \xc2\xa3150 as a service fee for the upgradeCalls and e-mails all result in the same robotic responseI have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel, especially to other countriesThis was more than $1,000 in additional costThe response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is availableI\'m very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic, where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again.This company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucherEven though I called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane12 hours without anything to eat because the sandwich I was given was inedibleThere was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hoursTotal waste of money having paid for Premium EconomyI am aware it was the beginning of the Covid19 issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service fromTheir attitude is unacceptable - it is all about money with them.Flight BA 282 on 11 February was delayed 173 mins due to mechanical in London and so I misconnected at London Heathrow and arrived 3 hrs 25 mins lateI requested compensation and was refused - for three e-mails they told me my flight to London was delayed 173 mins (under the 180 mins floor) and I continued toThen they started writing that I was able to make my original connexion which is untrueI don\'t know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence.The breakfast buffet in the BA lounge in Heathrow T5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable setteesis looking tired and old in comparisonAfter booking, HK closed it\'s borders so I could no longer get this flight11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone callI tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flightas there were hardly any left available and I didn\'t want to end up stuck in AustraliaI had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choiceThey told me that I was supposed to process an \'involuntary change\' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I\'d never evenSo now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amountThey were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don\'t know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about itWhen I said that wasn\'t good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not I will never use this airline again.During the time of Covid-19 it is normal, that a airline has to cancel their flightWhat\xe2\x80\x99s definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher - you can\xe2\x80\x99t use their voucher online or for a cheap flight - on the hotline they offer you noonline fare and just way more expensive prices! So stay far away from their voucherFor me as a regular traveler I will avoid BA as much as possible in the futureI even won\xe2\x80\x99t use my miles with BA...Do not accept a British Airways e-Voucher, go for a refundI stupidly accepted 2 e-vouchers and they are a waste of timeThey have no flexibility and despite the fact that BA has money and air miles belonging to me, I cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air milesflight, only an air miles flight that they don\'t have available at the time and route I wantBA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can\'t redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, only by speaking tothe call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to \'phone themI was a loyal Silver Card Executive Club member and still am, but after BA\'s approach, I will be avoiding them wherever possible in future.Whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean, the toilet was filthy.was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me moreSadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5could not go back to the AircraftThey gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a thirdparty company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost itemsBasically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their itemsMy laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they canThis was contrary to advice on Swedish Government websiteThey declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policyThe calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes BA standard of service compared to the other major European airlines was dishonest and obstructiveWhile in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy.I booked a flight with them on 26 of March, but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictionsSince then I am trying to call them every day! I also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a weeksaid she will transfer me to someone else, when she hang up on me!! Unbelievable!! So you can not even call them, and when you finally speak with someone nohelp at all! I never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus.Before hand, multiple lies and lack of information from the BA websiteThey cancelled my flight but they weren\'t honest about what they had done and liedThen my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that "all journeys complete"Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UKImpossible to get through to BA in LondonChaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren\'t accepting those boarding passesNo explanation for the change in policyI stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over asbadly managed: e.gI only fly BA because of the lack of choice on most routes - whenever there is an alternative I try that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently poorerThree days after arrival my mother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeralBut, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer servicesI spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed onlineOn the second day of my telephone ordeal I actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in \xe2\x80\x98holidays\xe2\x80\x99 who said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help me either but thatBut two days previously, when I tried to manage my booking online I was told I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this because I had bought a package and that this could onlyI do totally understand the turmoil caused by Covid-19, but never again BA.Very disappointed that BA are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid-19, effectively holding onto my money illegallyA voucher is not sufficientThe virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a 2 hour wait on the phoneVery disappointed - I expect much better from you!I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit frombut I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British AirwaysWhether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies toThe coronavirus is something that no one has any control ofI guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policyI want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this timeSomeone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from Goa to Mumbai and coughing throughout the journeyCategorically I was not on that flight, but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when I repeatedly said soI have a booking for March 19th, London Heathrow to Valencia, and BA still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund optionI know the airline is suffering, like the rest of UK industry and business, but how can they get away with such deceitful practicesIt is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds, and are not complying with the British FCO advisoryBritish Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madeira when the Foreign Office has advised against anything other than essential travelIf this is an example of BAs customer service I am not surprised they are in trouble.Lower Deck Club Class seat, with the current awful, narrow business class facing seatsBritish Airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best, and Club Class is simply terribleMy food was not fit for consumptionWIFI brokenCrew morale lowIFE quality a bad jokeTo add insult to injury, the  amenity packs are contemptibleWhat makes BA management think that business people require, (or indeed would retain) a package of socks, mask, plastic pen, and disposable tooth brush? The ongoing decline of this once-greatnational airline is palpable.Another grim flight with British Airways in Club Class, on a tired and old B747-400The Business Class at BA is by far the worst in the industryThe dreaded ying / yang configuration is going to be with us for some time, sadlyIn flight entertainment with tiny screen, no HD, and poor movie selectionWIFI did not work, as usualFood continues to be desperately poor, and crew were rather keen to disappear quicklyDiabolical that British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the Foreign Office have advised against anything other than essentialIf that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble.The 1 hour layover was a complete disasterThe staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me.London to Paris return group booking cancelledI know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline, but BA appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it isproving impossible to speak with themAfter the constant IT debacles this airline has, surely it is time for heads at the top to roll? Cancelled my booking for flight refund online, but they do notA 5 year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that BA currently has, and my patience of being loyal to BA (for over 40 yearsThe management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line.Flight got canceledThe lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogantExtremely rude staff and serviceThis is no way to treat passengers!, especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled!A few years back I took BA, the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since However, my recent flight is goodThe flight was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical reasons, but get back majority of the delay in the airUnfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure, but BA kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food courtcheck in hall wasn\'t helpful) Eventually, we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude - especially when we discovered we were seatedFlight cancelled due to \xe2\x80\x9cATC Restrictions\xe2\x80\x9d after Storm Ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hoursArrived in London 6 hours later than planned initially and BA refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reasonBooked 3 flights to Italy for March, all cancelledAI found thr food and seats on Euro Business a shame.I flew from Sydney to London to visit my seriously ill motherOn 20 February it became clear that Mum did not have long to liveSadly Mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 FebruaryNo follow up from eitherWhen I phoned BA again, they said they couldn\'t helpAt this point I gave up and booked with Qantas, paying for another flightBA\'s complete lack of compassion (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack of interest in helping me in any way, astounded meNeedless to say, I will never use British Airways again.Nothing special, nowadays there\'s unfortunately not much difference between BA & EasyjetBA seats no longer reclineLift your game BA, your product just continues to get worse.I had a painful back from runningThey decided to change my seat "for operational reasons"sThere is a number I can ring, 40 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and I give up.BA First is so much weaker than that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, I despairBut it is the food that is the standout problem on boardIt is poor and it is shameful that our flag-carrier represents Britain so badly in this regardsI only flew First because BA\'s business class is so poorI stood up and told her it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show her whom my husband is who gave me theGone are the days in which British Airways was a great airlineWeird seat configuration, service that needs training, horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by BA.Economy - packed out seating, awful food, very narrow seats, uncomfortable, expensive add ons (seat choice, luggage), try to match Norwegian pricing on the Rio route, IFE was iffyMy back and legs have been terrible for 3 days (I paid \xc2\xa377 for an exit seat), the breakfast served was unfit for me, I took my own drinks andLong haul is getting the same as shortThere was no support, guidance or remorse from the staffThe staff were great, but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class I\xe2\x80\x99ve experiencedThe seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configurationBA cancelled my return flight on 09-Feb-20 from Geneva to Gatwick due to storm CiaraThey rebooked me onto a later flight, then cancelled that as wellSince then, I heard nothing more and I was left on my own to buy a new return flightI\'ve tried calling them several times every day, but they are not answering their phones, claiming they are too busy to talk to customersThey cancelled my flight, so I want a refund, but so far there is no way of getting through to them.Another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the BA productI was told that because Manchester to Heathrow flight was missed, my Heathrow to Singapore was cancelled.I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not betterThis A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabinIberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money - don\'t waste your money on this.A negative was at the check-in, partly the website\xe2\x80\x99s fault, as we had done the online check inIt said we would have to pay extra, and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay \xc2\xa365 for each bagWhoever designed the refurbished Galleries Lounge at JNB has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a Facetime conversation was audible 20 feet awayAdd in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experienceFood was mediocre and I\'ve given up expecting anything more from BA\'s business class productThe White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissantA very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude)Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I\'ve paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia)We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass)My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should beNo wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offeredSleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague whoCombined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasantReally BA, you need to do much, much betterHad I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of tenBut I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halvesThe problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routesIn my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technicalThere are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etcThe clunky app kept just saying error for some reasonOn calling BA they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me because I \xe2\x80\x98failed\xe2\x80\x99 security- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company\xe2\x80\x99s travel departmentBA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issuedhad no explanation and only agreed to \xe2\x80\x98exceptionally\xe2\x80\x99 change my flight again after I complained about all of the aboveFinally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetenceBut old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrongOn 4th of December before my flight\'s departure I got my purse stolen in NYC with all my money and my passport in itWhen I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn\'t allowed to drop off my luggageDone this route a few times with British Airways over the years, first time and probably last in economy, old plane needs upgrade, poor entertainment systemUncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flightHowever, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of youAlso, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked inThey have a really weird policy that you can\'t carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it inThe ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in BostonAlso, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had comeEven after contacting BA\'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to meThey always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concernBritish Airways needs to improve their ground experience.Unfortunately, British Airways only gave me the seats I paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtripI have been fighting with British Airways to get my refund for these seat assignmentsDespite several phone calls and filing multiple on-line calls and providing them with detailed, my fightcontinuesTheir customer service is really poorI will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again.I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their serviceThe two major downsides: 1It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengersBA really need to get rid of itAlso, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriatingSeeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snacknot being included on the short-haul segment of my tripBA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short tripThe only gripe I had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by BALayout of Boeing 787 cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins (row 42-44 D, E, and F,)I would not recommend BA or the 787.However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flightto Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issueInstead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missingBeing a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t loaded the baggage they could notThe only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx200 people is rather not enough.Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their controlAfter take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not workingAnd we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happenWe contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodationSorry they saidDuring the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things aroundConclusion, never fly BA again.Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncratic \xe2\x80\x98four-course meal\xe2\x80\x99, I.eThe hot meal is invariably scorched around the edgesIt\'s not what it used to be but most importantly, it does not deliver what it promises any longer Disappointing food, outdated and uncomfortable seats, appalling baggage handling at LHR, and  mediocre crew service onboardThe customer service online is just as badBaby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move meHowever, my dealings with customer service was appallingThere are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroomLos Angeles to London on 6th January, and my husbands seat was brokenThe Customer Service Manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentionsIt was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter tasteA truly horrendous experience.Flight was lateMy food was bad and it was not possible to changeI paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the timeI was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economyWeather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be toughExpecting a delay and seeing other European flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boardingWell done.Fly economy and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be paying more for an awful serviceThe London to Vancouver route uses old planes, the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible.The staff were incredibly rude and lazyThe lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herselfBoth our TV\'s stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutesAs 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to I can tell you British Airways will not be itTerrible customer service.Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properlyThey have the worst customer serviceI\xe2\x80\x99ve flown many airlines around the world with my family, but surely we will never fly with British Airways againThey gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flewThe flight to London didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the best service, most toilets were out of serviceThe beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I\xe2\x80\x99ve flownThe check-in process at Heathrow was disastrousThe most inefficient process with no human assistancesThe limited ones available were all slammed with line of customersI would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrierWe had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check inWe had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned upOnce they did, the staff were surly and rudeOn the flight and there was no IFE, no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flightThe onboard crew were a bit chaoticHowever the BA product is now tired and slightly pathetic.The fitting of the cabin was horrendouson the taxiway to the runway but after an hour I must say I didn\'t really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than returnThe aircraft and the flight quality were good, but they don\'t provide free food and drinkIt was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling, so it ended quickly.Super slow, had to wait for buses which were delayedService bad from staffComing to Terminal 5 is the worst terminal on HeathrowThe food and beverage on board was terrible for the priceFor the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.I was not recognised as Oneworld elite flyer (hold a Gold Card with Qatar Airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggageI was denied lounge access as QR does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on QRThere is no Oneworld  lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with an entitled Oneworld card different from Qatar AirwaysOnboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not freeI found that the onboard charity collection by FAs is inappropriate and intrusiveOnboard there is no IFE, no seat reclineMediocre, not cheapWhich I might add I seldom enjoy food served on flights.Departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in Sofia, and complete failure to honour priority boardingLondon to Munich BA956 on 21 December, delayed by 25 minsDated not very clean A320Boarding process was slow and asking passengers to check their hand luggageTurns out plane is half emptyNo complementary drinks and snacks will be served on this flight with buy onboard in economyNever again.However when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didn\'t match her passport nameThey refused to let her fly, after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa, they enable her to flyIgot in contact with BAs\' executive phone helpline service, yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling meWe have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name onBA are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticketThey have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at handThey did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke English to her.When we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags, was charged 4 times for one bag after I was assured charges didn\'t go throughThey give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone! They have you do a claim online only to never respond to yourI sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bagOnly 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed withThey force you to communicate via email and then don\'t respond they owe me $258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point.FA is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to meI\'m a One World Emerald and the cabin manager did not greet meWhen they went to check in, those seat reservations (in both directions) had been given away and family had to sit in different seatsBack home, I applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof I paid for themI have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made, but there is no process to upload those documents to BA.Awful airlineA childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you don\'t book biz classAvoid.Flight is again delayed it\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s a one off as it\xe2\x80\x99s delayed every week like a bad jokeReally a poor yet very expensive airline who I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend to any traveller.Great service in Belfast but absolutely shocking in T5 at HeathrowVery rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcasesTotally disgustedI was apprehensive about flying BA Club World after reading many negative reviewsI explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when IDespite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his orderI told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new jobI wrote in to British Airways with my complaint, but they have not even bothered to respondAwful, rude airline.Completed a complaint and asked why BA thought this was ok, how come their representatives are allowed to lieNever flying BA again.The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on itThere\'s more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacyCrying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activityThe predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddledThe meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main courseUnfortunately BA hasn\'t done much work on their first class on these aircraftThe flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmaresNever again will I go to or through HeathrowHowever, this review is about BA\'s 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years agoHow does BA have the gall to call its service "business class"? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down onLet me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wallAside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputationNever again.The first thing is the shortage of staffUnfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrainedDespite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept droppingThere was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they would not offerEvery time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous courseThe layout of the business cabin is crampedI am 6\' and I could not stretch outThe seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengersThis means no one has a easy seatI wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business marketI travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would useUnfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn\'t get any betterThe food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main courseThe amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabinThe space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bedIf your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toiletThe toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enoughOverall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experienceThe head support was damaged, so I had to sit 10 hours leaned forwardThe flight from San Francisco was delayed, so I missed my connecting flight in London to OsloRude staff gave me a voucher for 15 GBP. He has no right to grab my passport and boarding passThe Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of filmsThe dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seatThe flight from Bangalore to London on 10 November 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flightMy return from London to Bangalore was initially delayed by 1.5 hrsWe were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for 30 mins announcement was made the flight was delayed 4hrs 27mins due to maintenance.I pay extra to check my bag, to ensure I am not using more than my share of overhead spaceTo have British Airways charge me 50 Euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a crampedaircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insultWill never fly BA again.However, BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger\'s are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic locationBecause I have several buses and trains to catch after I reach Glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to BA hence I\'m very disappointed withFirstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotelThe plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flightThe entertainment system was patheticNot much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no gamesThe drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in betweenMovie selection was below averageFist time I used the call button mid-flight response was fast, but on second occasion I was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutesI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how that is acceptable.What a disappointment of an airlineThey pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configurationWould not and could not recommended this airlineWithout a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but moreimportantly the poor customer service following the bad flightI truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliverI begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline.Due to delayed take off I risked missing my connecting flightI flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experienceFood service was very poor in most aspectsI had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the serviceThe one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completelyService itself was not good with no warmth or hospitalityOn a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone elseThe cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landingThe entertainment system is a joke as it is so oldBA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals onlyI cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a "mix up" with paperworkDisembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a "mix up" with landing bridge allocationWe missed our connecting flightThe staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to doWe ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delayAll of this inconvenience is due to BA\xe2\x80\x99s incompetent managementMy seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigreeThe flight attendants are rudeMediocreCabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motionsNo bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a \xe2\x80\x98nudge\xe2\x80\x99 before itNot a great Club Europe experience.Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinksOutbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horribleThey no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warmI was literally sweatingIt\'s not worth it.British Airways cancelled my September 11 flight due to the pilots strike, with advance noticeBA refunded my fare soon enough, but I am still awaiting a refund for the 70 Euro cost of baggage that I paid - six weeks laterNo actionI lodged another complaint on 25th October, and still no actionThey cancelled my flight, and won\'t refund my moneyAnd they call it Customer Service!British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasionInstead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staffMy mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by sideOn going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printedWaiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with noFor someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasionI have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointedan appropriate apology is not issuedWill update! In summary, don\xe2\x80\x99t trust BA with your loved ones care.This was a huge mistakeI had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do soThen I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back optionWhen we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgradedBA\xe2\x80\x99s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all haveThen there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade)the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they couldAt one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After twoIf British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid businessfare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.The TV screen of 12F was broken, could not be locked into position that would allow to watch moviesFlight attendants could not fix it, and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked inThe back of the seat in front was dirtyThe tray on the 12D where I was moved to, had a hole on the right side, and the TV screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated byI arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed, I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have toleave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the planeIn London I made a complaint but they were saying that we can\xe2\x80\x99t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hourand 47 minutes of waitBoth legs travelled with hand luggage only, and I could not choose a seat without payingFair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premiumprice seems mean to say the leastHand Luggage fares are last to board, make them uncomfortable on board, no free food nor drink.Worst customer experience I have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action, no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be toldReturn flight was canceled at London City Airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking, hotel voucher and transportation arrangedThat was certainly over and beyond what I expectedVery poor experience my flight with BAthe 2-4-2 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical classOne toilet closed (nobody around to repair ?)its even more freezingwhy do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip ? no staff to answer my questionno staff to make it betterA terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitudeAt the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from MalagaStiff and no recliner seatsCabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudesHorrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price.We were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanationExtremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators.My flight from London to Singapore in premium economy was the worst I have experiencedThe seat was uncomfortable, the flight tracker failed after two hours, the breakfast prior to arrival in Singapore (scrambled egg) was like rubberThey ran out of cups and so my wife and I had no coffee, tea or drink with our breakfastI used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutesI never saw the crew member again. I asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking forWith the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant goingABreakfast I was offered tea or coffee (even decaf), I accepted, but there was no milk or cream for me.Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came throughThe baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a differentairline, which I missedHoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sandIt ended up costing my wife and I almost $3000 for new tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the airport and British Airways refused to offerWe will never use this airline again.British Airways is a glorified budget airlineA 3.5-hour flight and back to Athens and no food or drinks providedAsk for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous priceNo entertainment options eitherYet they charged full-service airline pricesSo there is a mismatchTerrible lack of any leg and body room in economyThis was easily the most cramped space I have ever flownThe flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfortThe little amount of space in economy cabin is disgustingShamefulThe food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane foodI will never fly British Airways againI should only add that the NYC JFK and London waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the callHorrible excuse for an airline.The aircraft is very old, cabin configuration is very old and tiredIFE screens have not been changed since they were first installedI never got anyFood choices ran out in the first rowSeats were uncomfortable, footrests were jammedPoor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seatsHaving flown Norwegian on their B787 in their premium cabin on the same route, BA is a waste of my money.Not very tastyNot bad, not excellentNo IFE, no onboard serviceThe seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat, seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort, I got no sleepA snack was served after take off which was quite tasty, but breakfast was just dismal, tastelessWould not travel with British Airways in this cabin again, really not worth the price tag.After many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pmThe following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same "technical" fault reported 24 hours previouslyFinally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to AmsterdamWE also had to pay for our "no show" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay forWhat really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandledOnce on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdatedOur connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight tripsDownside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.Literally the worst experienceWe have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time! They should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch!Flight from London to Athens with British Airways, was one of the worst experiencesThe "new" slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in painThe screens with flight info have gone, no frills, and airline has become a bad quality budget airlineSadAvoid.Food was just ok, although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldn\'t be my first choice to serveThe seats are incredibly uncomfortableFor a 9 hour flight this is painfulPaid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been onFor a long time I have avoided taking British Airways due to it\xe2\x80\x99s poor past reputationBritish Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total liethe airport for our connection, we missed the layover flightThey kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London\xe2\x80\x99s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any wayBritish Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experiencedI will never be flying BA again and plan on converting my company away from BA flights as wellStay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise.BA don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you there is no lounge at Kos airportVery noisy limited facilitiesNot sure I will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don\xe2\x80\x99t warn of limited facilitiesIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that the flight is delayed by an hour!Travelling Club Europe had no advantagesHonestly you wouldn\'t have thought it was the same company3.5 hours (1 hour sitting on tarmac) with my knees rammed against seat in frontI literally cannot think of any real negativesSadly, the current CEO doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightfulThe only slight issue was the very IFE systems and small overhead lockersI did not actually fly because of their pilot strikeThis review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strikeI immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question andhad to pay \xc2\xa3110 more for a return flightHow do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were strikingI completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to meI never received the refund.The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BAAs it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutesI thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently notLanding made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flightsDelays after delaysThe flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago Time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airportFinally, at 10 pm we managed to board on the A380 for my first time but the legroom was horribleThe IFE completely unfunctional and with no food servedWe had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flightHaving booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the dayPersonally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctlyAgain I\'m not a fan of thisAgain it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airlineI wouldn\'t even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via On Business1 bag lost in transitGround crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bagWaited for next flight to arrive, still no bagDecided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that\'s a lesson learnt the hard wayDue to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to returnApparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless,Abysmal customer servicesNo wonder their reputation is in tattersI will never fly BA again.Yet it charges \'full service\' prices!Flight between London and Istanbul is like coach, no TV and small leg roomTransatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bedFood was below averageThe Heathrow BA business lounge was a cramped, tasteless, dirty lounge Food was  awful and service is even worstWhen we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of $500 plus fee change, so we ended up paying $800 perThe return from London to Phoenix was a nightmareI want everyone to know that I sent a complaint 3 times but there is no one to talk toThis is not something that I am used to.Boarding was by the now standard groups, which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridgeOnce in the air, cabin crew delivered the usual Club Europe experience, which was mediocre at bestOverall, a typical BA experience that\xe2\x80\x99s lacklustre at best.It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them againUnfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to DublinI was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it onI am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possessionBA\xe2\x80\x99s customer service is terribleIf someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in thesame city I\xe2\x80\x99m in for more than a day and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get itTalk about serious frustrationI don\xe2\x80\x99t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out theUnfortunately she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morningI did not receive that level of service from BAI even asked if they could call the airport and was told, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not authorized to call airports.\xe2\x80\x9d Why in the world wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be authorized to call theirown baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help meThis has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two yearsIf you do check a bag and it\xe2\x80\x99s lost or delayed, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect any help if you flew with BAAn email on the 25th August advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmareArriving at HK airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to printWe had to wait ages for BA to open a check in desk, pretty average food and service in the Qantas loungeA broken screen in seat 59A (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbingA ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flightThe plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbishtools they will serve rubbishThe night term pantry offering was a total jokeI have been a BA Exec card holder since for ever and I have seen is a decline in the service levelCertainly not value for money, we did not get a Club class experience on the flight home.When my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50GBP because one of the suitcases was 4cm oversize,Staff said that if he did not pay, he would lose the flight.Return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at Lagos - and had to be flown back to Abuja with a 2 hour delayFlight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area wherethere was no food facility and waited for the flightFlight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelledBreakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellowThe aircraft was clean but old and down at heel - the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the "floor" was visible.What an awful planeReally uncomfortableThe meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushedThe main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 filmsRubbishTook 2 hours to get the screens to actually workThe plane looks old and tiredNot a pleasure to travel on this plane.BA are getting a lot of bad press - deservedly so at present with strikes, IT glitches, baggage problemsTerrible flight experience, bed bugs in old Club world seats, missed meals, poor serviceComplaints is outsourced to a German company who aren\'t even part of BA!  Do not fly BA and club world is a waste of money.Was met by a rude lady at First class check in and the process took about 20 minutes, don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, no apologyThe welcome wasn\xe2\x80\x99t especially friendly, just pointing the direction where to goThe CSM never came to say helloThe seating was terrible on this A320, so tight.Travelling home was extremely disappointingThe aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbeltThe aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengersThe aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficultThe breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal barThe standards on BA have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame(Etihad, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do this?)Economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than manyHuge disappointment for BA business class service in European routesSeat pitch has been reduced to 30" over the last years (from 34") at the expense of passenger comfortFood for me was half-empty plates representing a deli experience, and leaving me hungryOut of the three options offered, two were already out of stock, so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food optionAvoid Club Europe, not worth the money.I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcookedThe latter I took one bite and couldn\'t continueThe service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is availablePaid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to useConsidering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missingThe bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refundedI called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expensesI was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British AirwaysI have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of moneyThe food was no better than economy food from the pastThe seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant peoplewho thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy peopleOnce at LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelledOn a busy day, I waited for hours at the airportthe delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pmI kept on waitingThe flight eventually ended up cancelled as wellResult: half a day wasted at LCYI feel that BA\xe2\x80\x99s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly latelyDelays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdammakes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not.However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euroI have been trying to speak to British Airways on Twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing theBritish Airways is being dishonest and should be avoided.However, the First galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was badThe entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like Qatar Airlines and EmiratesHowever, their customer service has fallen to such a level that I must say it is terribleIf you have any problems you will not be able to get any helpThey erroneously cancelled my seats although I had checked in over 5 hours before he flightThey then lost my luggage for 15 daysThese things happen but customer service was impossible to useWhen you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs upIf you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to youYou can\'t find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messagesDo not take this airline if customer service may be important to you.The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotionsSomehow I missed the flight backI have no excuse for thisI had a break downAnd again they did not ask for a penny for our return flightsI will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible.My flight was cancelled 3 days in a rowEverything about the customer service, customer relations has been terrible, hours of waiting on the phone, no answers on emailMy other flights with BA this year has been delayed tooThey have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$First 10 days, then 21 bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yetThe whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wifeMy wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staffTherefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do soAnd the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on theThe system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failedUnfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the \'found\' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4thApparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong dateThey were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for usWe believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it upWe were so confused which bag was really missingHowever, when we came to the airport again, we couldn\'t find our luggage and the staff didn\'t explain why and just told us to leaveIf the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy andThis service was totally unacceptableWe spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can\'t imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staffevery day and not getting anywhereThat\'s how ridiculous things have been for usMy wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.I am seriously considering not doing this againThe 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and oldI flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operatedCrew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experienceThe food and drink selection was pretty basicHowever the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpfulI forgot to collect my suit which I had handed to crew member at the time of boardingUpon approaching the BA counter, the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain Neither any empathy nor any willingness to help.Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHRWithout this transfer help we would have missed our connectionOne small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn\'t that bad asThis was the worst experience I have ever had flyingThe bags did not arrive and we spent two days in London without our bagsI left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claimYour website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothingOn the return flight from London to Newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lockWith an experience like this on our first vacation to London, I would do everything to never fly British Airways again.The aircraft was narrow, the food simple nothing worth spending my moneyThe staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn\'t worth itNo entertainment onboardOn arriving at Gatwick airport and checking in I learn that my interpretation of the USA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply for a newHowever there is no free food and drinks provided.BA customer service is unquestionably the least helpful, least accommodating, least friendly and least responsive so called service availableThey clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customersI will try to avoid this airline from this point on.The seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardinesThe seats are aging and uncomfortableThe forward-backward configuration is the most stupid I have seenThe only problem was at Heathrow, because the gate bridge had a malfunction, so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraftA shambolic airlineRude and incompetent Iberia ground staff in MalagaBA sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began - sophisticated IT setup they have! Club Europe meal remains a big cutback from 2017 despiteCabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor Simply appalling trip and truly ripped off.Extremely disappointed tripThey are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carouselOur baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they can\xe2\x80\x99t even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departureMany important things are in the checked baggage and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have further trip later on which affected us badlyHaving previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flighthome I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also cancelled due to a fault with the aircraftEventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crewSome people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothingVouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means toUtterly appallingAgain flight is delayedIt\xe2\x80\x99s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don\xe2\x80\x99t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customersTrouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave itVery tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service.A supremely awful experience from beginning to endFlight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time inOnly told once on board what the problem wasDelays at baggage reclaim meant I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm)This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changedFlight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the planeDue to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flightFood was awful and we got a choice of one mealSpent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelledQueued for hours to get some information from someoneThey rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boardingThis means I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festivalHad to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for thisNow I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have towait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with meThese are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I\xe2\x80\x99m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been providedBetween this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they canCheck in problems and a hugely delayed flightPay premium prices for a below average serviceMy flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managedto cut more costsThe handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part ofThey make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost theirHow does British Airways get away with having such a useless IT system and presumably team of IT staff / management? These issues recur on such a frequent basis itJust read a fatuously stupid interview with Alex Cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel, when this man cannot manage to runI have been a loyal customer for over 48 years, and it seems that BA have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and havebeen through all the lows of BA without complaint until nowMy patience has run out.DisappointingAll the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn\'t turn up, so trip was ruinedTwo weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from British Airways we\'ve found out that our seats has been moved to "unlucky" 13 inbound and to a 8They\'ve split all family quite far away apart from each other as wellCustomer Service has hang up on us for the first time, and second phone call has promised to call back but never didWill I ever over pay (\xc2\xa32000 difference) so I can have "Good customer Service with British Airways ever again? - the answer is no I am extremely upset (that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason), disappointed and you can no longer rely on British Airways.Staff were not in high standardsLooked rushed and not polite, did not look professional enoughIn our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraftThere was not welcome snacksVery sad and staff did not care about this situation.My daughter was beeped, but it wasn\'t a big dealMy flight from Nice was delayed in the plane for 2 hours and in delayed in Heathrow for 5 hoursWhen we finally left the plane, there were no information on how I get another connecting flight since due to the delay I had to miss itNow it was 3am with no one to speak too and I still don\'t have my bagsI had to grab a taxi to sleep (BA didn\'t not provide a hotel stay)The entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen .This negatively affects the legroomIt is quite abundant but not very delicious.What happened to a great airline? Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutesThere was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boardingGot to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bagGot to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell usDuring day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not processSpeak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises toGet Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours beforeWhat a useless organisationHeld in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to whyOn boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great startUsual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste ofThe breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cuttingBA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike asMale cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker.I was flying BA to Delhi in economy because my original flight with Swissair was cancelledIts a pity i didn\'t get their names i was panickyNoisy cabin, tiny screens, collapsing headrest, chocolate on my seatPoor food with choices running out.Mykonos to London flight delayed and waiting to departThey are not on time, be prepared to miss your connections, take off 2 hours late,The staff is some of the worst I have had on airlinesYou may be stuck on the runway and they won\xe2\x80\x99t offer you any water The worst business class experience I have had.Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business classI did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seatThey were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight timeIn Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/boardFor me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2\'\' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eatI also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed....A two hour flight on 27th July was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by BAThere was no sympathy or compensation , especially as our original flight was early morning, and with an email informing us of the delay, we could have stayed longer inI flew yesterday from Heathrow to Manchester in business class, from start to finish it was a shambles I was sent to the wrong baggage drop, then to the wrong lounge, I showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gateThe boarding process was more like a rugby scrum, no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was neededno explanation was given for this.The first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight, however on the ground in London the problems startedThe gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutesone cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiserWorst business class flight I have flownSplit seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbookedThe meal was inedible for me, and was the worst airline meal I have been served.Seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flightNo drink, no snack, no bottle of water was offeredWhen I asked, they said none were left in stockThey gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passportsI was not given a menu, I even had to ask for itI was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleepingOk fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the mealAnd after all, no apologies from the staffToo many people are squeezed into business classI\'m very disappointed and will never use it againI won\'t recommend British Airways business class to anyone!Premium economy don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly)wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn\xe2\x80\x99t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a(Not really a saving grace)One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don\xe2\x80\x99t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother trying itOh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was anBut that really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happenentered TSA line that\xe2\x80\x99s the one that\xe2\x80\x99s empty cause they tell no one about it.Business class is just economy class with an empty middle seatNo leg room for mePoor staff spent most of the flight apologisingNever fly British Airways.This is unacceptable so I opt to cancel and full refundThere is nothing left of business class on these flightsWhen they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad jokeSeats are the same as coach, they took forever to hang my jacket after I asked in three occasions, they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coachseat without window! (See picture) and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing tobring the extra hand luggage that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit anymore in coach to business classRidiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes forFeel totally ripped off.Awful experienceOur flight arrived over 2 hours late at 8.50pm, so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our carWe had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensiveOur new car hire was three times the price since it was last minuteBritish Airways would not help compensate because they said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their fault.Complete confusionThe plane was delayed getting to Sardinia, and so we waited: but following check-in at Sardinia we were penned into long lines, no seats, extreme heat and no water inThe airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmedFinally got onto the plane and we\xe2\x80\x99re now delayed on the tarmacWe are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updatesNo water providedI felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drinkNumerous small children with no hydration and high temperaturesThey need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwellCabin crew just standing there, doing nothing but looking perplexedAfter waiting for 6 hours at Rotterdam airport (delays) I was told they re-routed my flight to Amsterdam and that I needed to quickly catch a taxi (that I haveAs I worried I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it, I asked to be put in a hotel & fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as allAnd throughout the process & long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happeningWhat a waste of time, energy & moneyAnd no apology to make up for the hours or delayWe boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crewpartner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told sheit was burntThey reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate theThe only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eyeOn this trip like the previous the plane broke down, and we waited 2.5 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degreesOnly BA could try to make money out of one of its technical failuresI then waited another hour to pick up my suitcaseI regret using itBA762 Heathrow to Oslo I have flown with BA a few times in the last few months, I have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes,Initial flight from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was cancelled, had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as wellService with not a free glass of water on the first legAbu Dhabi to London delayed by over 3hrsThe pilot introduced the flight attendants as \xe2\x80\x9cgorgeous\xe2\x80\x9d - which came across to me as inappropriateSensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafterVery basic foodLanding cards have been done away withNo complimentary food or drink on this segmentI felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understandThe transfer at Heathrow is anxiety-inducing.On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not workThe M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standardAlso a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seatsOutbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BAPerhaps standards at LGW are not as good as at LHR.Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey outUnique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of messI arrived 3 hours before flight where I waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail likeAfter that rather lengthy delay.When I got to the gate on time, I was told the gate was shutAfter asking what do I do now? Not having the ability to ring abroad I asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no Qantas officein Amsterdam and they cannot help me.However 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hoursI had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though I was already logged inChecking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time differenceI was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dreamFood choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, butThere was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for waterOur return flight from KL to London was very cold, the Boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat.Crew was pretty average Seat was averageNo inflight entertainment.Nightmare experience with British Airways almost constantlyMy Business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours long-hauls flight! Lounge simy sucks, cheap, noisy and croweedMultiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded tableGiven the price it Charge, certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take.Economy was a lot more cramped than I expectedFood reasonable really although I had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shameI probably won\xe2\x80\x99t use them in November when I go back 2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio featureDelays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight The BA business class I flew for the first time recently was the worst I have  flownWhereas most have four seats across British Airways has eight! The lay down beds are hard, thin and shortNot worth the money.the flight horrible.It was 10 hrs on a delayed flight, in a cramped seat with no lights, no call lightNo entertainment of any sort, and food I found exceptionally badThe B747 that was terribly maintainedThe offer of 20.GBP for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety.The special meal I ordered was not on either of the two flightsI submitted a complaint to ba.com and the responses I received were lame and unacceptableNot a stitch of good will was forthcoming from British Airways, as I suggested topping off my Avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500).The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flightMy boyfriend therefore hated it, as we\'re used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorifiedOnce we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5it felt very crowded and hotAfter my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy peopleI had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stankThe food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the "tea" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrapThose smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer thereThe worst airline Trans-AtlanticDespite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this tripThe flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San JoseThe airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with dividerBusiness Class on British Airways is the worst of any airlineThe WIFI was out of serviceOn late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothesOn my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apologyI am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations departmentIt is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrierBritish Airways treat their premium class customers with contemptThis is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow.The check in process was disgusting45 minutes queuingto a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutesWhen the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternityI have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in deskqueue with the additional wording of \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re in for a long wait\xe2\x80\x9dTo cap it all, after enduring the queue, we\xe2\x80\x99re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!When I arrived I waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcaseIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t arriveIt hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been deliveredAs I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointlessSo I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials thatMy boyfriend and I wanted to return from our trip to London a day early but the BA app and website continued to glitch so I called to ask howThe flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins lateWe missed our eventThe plane was filthy and my tv didn\xe2\x80\x99t workI called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can\xe2\x80\x99t give us a refund because we got on theSomebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn\'t fit the bag in the space remaining, so they kept the bag on my laptop bagI am a frequent flyer with BA and have not always had an amazing experience, this one wasLast Sunday we unfortunately missed our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances, so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with EmiratesAt check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flightWe have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought.Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I receivedI was not well enough to walk to the car parkThis caused an issue when trying to seat togetherIt was irritating because one of us was ill.Usual on board trolley service which I didn\'t useFlight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes lateThe seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seatThe only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in LeedsThe airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seenThere was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we hadThat\'s despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolutionThe dinner service was according to the new CW \'soft\' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individuallyThe legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated pricesWhere did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through securityService announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via textsThe delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation I will never set foot on this airline again. The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisoryThe screen was small and in poor conditionMovies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poorThe touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally, without warning, increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handsetA 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system.Service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flightDuring the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business classI was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillowThe menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinaryThe breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatableBA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck inI am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for methe flight uneventfulThe return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few yearsOnce again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through everypart of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordealThe pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less)No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missedA very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had madeOverall, the return flight was extremely poor.I am generally annoyed with the quality of the serviceI realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport controlThe whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpetsIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooringFood and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem for meThe food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offeredPriority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevantMy bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bagsThe inflight service for the outbound leg was less than idealThe food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over itThere was serious bumps along the way midflightThe baggage drop area however was a disasterNone of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengersStill, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn\'t had its refurbishment and was showing its ageA wardrobe door that\'s falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won\'t stay shut don\'t pass muster in First and blemishThe IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single filmissue; this resulted in over an hour\'s delay leaving NYI was not happy because I had the permitted allowance.Overcrowded lounges, business class seats same as economy with middle seat emptyAnd now frequent flyers don\xe2\x80\x99t get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets.I paid an extra \xc2\xa3500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointedThe seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very darkI tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchableThe whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any wayI would advise avoid British Airways Premium economy as it is far from PremiumI felt a complete waste of \xc2\xa3500.Flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disasterSpoke to BA desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct itIt is a shambles and a disgraceWaited 39 mins got cases at Heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them againAvoid at all costs.All so wrongLounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid, left most of itApparently on top of a \xc2\xa32000 six night holiday I should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner - total madnessThis is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked Norwegian for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos Aires, did not even bother to lookHaving travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn\'t overly impressedMy return journey couldn\'t have been more differentHaving had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for allAircraft was not fullThe most disappointing business class I have flown in a long timeThe plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks serviceto reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cookedThey seemed to be short on staffHowever, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I\xe2\x80\x99dThe service was exceptionally poorI am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flightUltimately though - sorry BA, not good enough.Their customer service is horribleLost our bagsWe fly out in 3 hours to Barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we goWe have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it\'s now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreakingNot one single person at British Airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matterOne customer service agent even asked me if we would be OK getting out to Heathrow to "pick them up." Truly the worst customer experience I\'ve had.I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (fromWe lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refundReturning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about itI understand that unforeseen situation can happen, but I have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life.I missed out on the airline meal and when I realised I buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water, explaining the problemdrink and left me to it.The worst business class trip for usFilm/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn\xe2\x80\x99t workingThe food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to usIf one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get itI would never choose to travel BA again.My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London)Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was noBritish Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flightHowever, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to haveBut this experience proved to me that it\'s not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia\'s systems since after paying for and closingBA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seatsAdditionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seatsNo explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without noticeWe\'ll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS hasalways reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, againJust simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business classRated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocatedThe caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another feeOverall the product is outdatedService was not at the level it used to be Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flightI certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t use their services in foreseeable future.Video system did not work for more than 1 hour, then work for a few hours and stopped workingNo WIFI, very old planeNot good for business traveling.The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you seeThe only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived lateThis meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flightThis was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flightAll very stressful.This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this lengthHaving paid \xe2\x82\xac1000 for my flight it\'s disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is soIf the person in front reclined their seat it\'s a nightmareThe seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing.I would have had to pay about thirty poundsThe check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airportI was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fansIn the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley serviceThe overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in GermanThe booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can bookMy gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirtyThe onboard service was abysmalDinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight)My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he\xe2\x80\x99d been forgottenI requested \xe2\x80\x98Express\xe2\x80\x99 service, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t happenDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste your money with this airline, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don\xe2\x80\x99t paySt Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flightOnce in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgradedthe poor service we had received from BAwet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seatsWhat further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior toBA\xe2\x80\x99s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwardsCancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flightCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortableI always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to do this.This was the worst experienceI flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rudeI was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughterI found the food portions so meagreNot sufficient for a child also British Airways is sad in every sense of the term.No free service at all, everything has to be purchased at inflated pricesHeathrow T5 the usual chaosToilets filthyOne of the worst lounges I\xe2\x80\x99ve seenBoeing 788 IFE screen brokenSeats very uncomfortable and narrowService and food quality averageFlight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced beforeRest of the journey uneventfulOverall a rather disappointing experienceBA cannot compete with the Middle Eastern carriers.caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choiceIt cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product,Couldn\'t have been a better serviceThe disappointment was the receptionist at the Galleries Lounge at T3 who was rude and unhelpfulFood not great but on a par with economy in other airlinesThe cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home aboutThe screen is small, with poor resolutionThis First does not compare well with that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, but BA business class is so poor, I either fly economy or (when I am veryI had a miserable experience in first class from London to ChicagoI had requested a special meal but that was not availableWhen I complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 K milesThe bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebonesCabin crew never asked what I wanted and were only available when you press the call buttonIn flight entertainment is poor.Customer services handling of my question never answered itThree times I asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over \xc2\xa3100 on the outbound flightThey never could explain why the fare increased by over \xc2\xa3100 when I indicated one checked bagI asked to speak with someone but that was never responded toCustomer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive.This is the worst experience I have had on a flightThe crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to themThere was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlinesThe attitude and service of the crew was abysmalThis was nothing but a waste of moneyI doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again.Leg room is also non existentM&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights howIt\'s clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bringM&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisleLarnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but weThe second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, "we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airlineA midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a "balance problem"In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with butthe system identified it as extra baggageHow British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me.Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the "turn right" sectionin Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boardingBecause of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American AirlinesI went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already onI went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delayShe did not offer any explanations or anythingAmerican Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodationI ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues withAfter paying \xc2\xa34000 for flights which I had to cancel, they wouldn\'t allow any change of dates or change of name, and after all that wouldn\'t give me the AviosThe only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they don\xe2\x80\x99t serve anything free on all European routes.Not even free water on board in economy.I paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when I got to the airport they wouldn\'t let me on the flight because someone on their sidemessed up when they booked my seats, so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can\'t do anything and I can\'t getThey waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won\'t reimburse me for the seats that I paid for, but neverArrived at airport to be told that we\'d been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbookingApologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the planeFuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy foodBA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apologyEvidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak seasonGeneral quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few yearsBA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airlineAvoid this airline if you possible canAnd the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge \xc2\xa340 to pre reserve in Club and \xc2\xa370 in Premium EconomyOn this performance you don\'t deserve to stay in business.Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn\'t do enough for meFood quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit meanThe most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the worldBA should be ashamed of themselvesThe seats are the biggest conThree seats for two - with a dumb table in the middleUnless you are in the front row the leg room is a disasterOn the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileronAs an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big dealClearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff planeThe planes are ancient and need to be replacedThe seats are uncomfortable and wornThere is no lumbar supportIt\xe2\x80\x99s really claustrophobicThe food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choiceSo for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible foodThe short connecting flights do not even offer bottled waterThe M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choicesThe planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthyThere was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her jobBoarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get toBritish Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking feeWe feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matterIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirtyThe return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not workA marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing inBritish Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for.Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the returnI am only 5\'2" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too crampThe onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the timeThe food was barely edibleComing back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as badI was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled upThis was the worst flight I have flown onStaff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorableFirst flight, overnight from JFK to Heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then goneChair is set up so I\xe2\x80\x99m staring at a stranger, it\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructionsDidn\xe2\x80\x99t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken upNow I\xe2\x80\x99m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats withI didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flightsI won\xe2\x80\x99t fly BA again.Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industryIt is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400\'s, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where youThe crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possibleBreakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneatenInsufficient chairs, and a single, old TVDoes no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers.Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400The British Airways First Class product doesn\'t come up to modern Business Class standardsThis particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awfulThere is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophisticationThis experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chainFinally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twiceThe First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortableBritish Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class productAll that can be said about this airline is woefulThe Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment.Very disappointing serviceCabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed - payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwardsNot only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebookingOn their site I had the option to reschedule my flight but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t select any flights on the same dayWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page?The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained.Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the worldThere is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselvesdown with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat itBad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocketThe entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying)My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually availableFor ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work.Bag drop did not go wellAs a consequence, the service was negligent in the extremeThis was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of serviceI complained to BA when I got home but they weren\'t interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudesThis flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline.Much improved, well done.BA broke my suitcase and I did not make a fuss, I just got a new oneSo on top of the new suitcase, I had to actually pay BA to check the new bagCost me over $100 for their mistakeYou will get an email a month later saying "I\'d like to know you that we are unable to offer refund"Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.\r\nEvery aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offerThe plane was shabby and datedThe seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlinesThe touch screen TV monitor was not working properlyOne ear bud on the headphones did not workThe audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice)The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy coverThe air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold airHowever what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crewThey were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be thereThere did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the mealsOur two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew memberThis flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flightThere was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landedI couldn\'t imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the priceBut first class on BA is not worth the fareWhen I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller.Classic BA love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disasterProblems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutesTotal chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priorityEven though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problemsThen flight does not have enough food onboardCheck-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after anotherThis caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell startedThe crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leaveSo a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take offWe spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to usThe overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London.On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flightThis was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey tooThe seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger\'s footrest to accessWe both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been tooMy only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.running a little behind schedule and I had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departsOnline Check-in did not work, no reason was givenAnswers were either, that call could not be completed, check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right nowI did not make it throughThe lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats availableSo I\xe2\x80\x98ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customersB On my flight to San Diego 5 days ago, my TV screen was gone and there was no way to change seatsHowever on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at GatwickWhen I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! They overbooked! My choicewas then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight! They just did not care about their customerNo phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the boarding gateThe plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issuesWhen I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could helpI finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days, it was impossible to get someone on the phoneOn my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats availableIt is clear that this company just don\'t care about their customers, they just care about their money !The only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized.Plane boarded on time, very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit, given aircraft at JNB all day, perhaps this could have been addressedThen bed, gap in seat made lie flat less comfortableDelay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue (there seemed to be a few of these)Overall an average experience.Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment systemI spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutalI apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything toThe staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself upThe crew were also extremely noisyThe staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flightBecause of an engine problem, the flights from LHR to JNB was delayed by 2:45hAn extremely average flightNothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as badHowever BA have stripped both the above perksI now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost doubleBut some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner, they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudlyThen 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not toThis was really poor serviceEspecially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the rawsThats what you call bad customer service! ps: i was charged 100$ for a luggage, after buying my ticket 350$A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilotsThe cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experienceThe food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocreWarm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experienceThe duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabinIt would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was madeWiFi was available but I didn\'t make use of itBreakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offeredDeplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a standOn arrival in Dublin the ground service from Swissport was poor, it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staffWhatever happened to the World\'s Favourite Airline? Returning from Bermuda to Gatwick we were presented with a worn-out Boeing 777My seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging offI had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn\'t work, tray ended up on the floorReported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me \'I\'ll put it in the book\'No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from himThe food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish itIt also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the saladMy wife\'s entertainment screen, didn\'t work, the passenger next to me screen didn\'t work and mine only worked intermittentlyWe purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn\'t get a premium serviceInitially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I\'m glad I didn\'tMy frustration with BA grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too.The flight entertainment system are outdatedI am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selectionFood choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business classI moved away from BA, the only issue I have that now I have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlinesThe breakfast served just before landing was terribleA terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit barHardly anyone ate it what a waste.There was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flightApparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plusback row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toiletsOnly 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against usCabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at allImpossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service roundsTatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our kneesWhen asked for help the stewardess told us she didn\'t have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type ofI understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasantI paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seatI understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters areIt is bafflingThe ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny theyAnd why am I flying BOAC? They owed me \xc2\xa325 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all hadto sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flightOn top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must\'ve beenAnd of course you only get compensation by patronising them againNow I know: ever a free ticket on BOAC is overpriced.Worst long haul business classThat annoying divider, the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats! The service is non-existent, unless they are serving you the mealThe toilets are dirty and basicThey\xe2\x80\x99ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it\xe2\x80\x99s not like they\xe2\x80\x99re cheap.Not my best flight.Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn\'t work and it wasn\'t clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to beAt BLR, no online check-in available and slow processPlane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not lockingracks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow providedNo USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and ageVOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies)To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resetsFood volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound legInsufficient lavatories for Premium Economy and Economy.My flight from Barcelona to London was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connectionsWhen I finally got a flight, we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectlyI called and emailed every day and they couldn\'t find it even though I had a tag number and and documentationThe final insult is that I was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven daysAs a result, they have offered me no compensation for damages.Charging to choose seats, even within 24h prior take off, is outrageousSo we did, when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use forWell it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refundedThey instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciationDespite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund.Terrible service and foodCramped uncomfortable seats and terrible entertainment, in one of my flights it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t workingThe crew couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less, I will not fly with them again !!!The seats booked not given, took 3 months to respond to a complaint after submitting multiple messages to them for an updateA dirty plane, fantastic front line staff I would never fly BA again.First class ground staff but in the air it\'s quite a disappointmentThe basic economy seats have so little cushion it is agony to sit for longer than 15" in themI forgot I had purchased a hand baggage only fareAt the airport I was charged more than 60 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself costThe staff at check-in could not have been less helpfulThe whole experience was of a bad low-cost airlineBoarding process saw me in Category 5 having to board last, not so much as a glass of water is offeredThe seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the A319 economy cabin.As the arm rests do not go all the way up, the middle/window seat passengers have to climb overThere is little leg room and no leg restLegroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his/her seatThe seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read British Airways\' magazine or even use my iPadBare bones service, no meals (which is okay), no complimentary soft drinks or waterSomething went wrong with my booking, I was supposed to fly at 18:10 (with my boyfriend) back home to South Africa after our visit in UK, but somehow my ticketWas it worth it? I\'d say broadly yes, though I wouldn\'t want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one legBit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.On approach to the airport, I got a message saying that my flight was canceledAs I arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel inThe airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issuesAs it was Christmas, prices were very highI have had my battles with the leadership at BA because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their AirmilesIs this BA\'s attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their productwater bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fineWorst flight experience24hrs they decide to cancel the flight and give me the alternative for another flight 3 hrs laterI send email and I had same response twice: Flight never operated or rescheduledI think they had overbooked flight and didnt care about it.Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issueWe flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn\xe2\x80\x99t workingHaving complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixedWe were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practicalThey said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer usI replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had saidI also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to meThere was no other alternative or any means of reasoningThe flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortableCheck-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggageBoarding process is a mess as there wasn\'t priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraftThe only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn\'ta problem)I didn\'t buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cardsIt was one hour flight so I didn\'t expect the top service standardThis aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been onI reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordealyears of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadfulWith their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.\r\nAfter booking the flight and trying to upgrade, was notified that I could not upgrade the flight due to how I purchased the ticket, paid about $250 for early seatselection on both flights, after buy up to the front of the plane, was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation, -but found out they gave the seats, that I paid extra for, to another partyCould request a refund, but wouldn\'t honor what they had sold me in the first placeThey would not honor a refund eitherThen I became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of $3380 plus paid for upgrades.Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller)I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crewThe trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleepThe crew never came back until breakfastThat flight was a total disappointment.I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choiceI made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hoursCrew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn\'t help eitherThe tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn\'t watch anything during the whole duration of the flightI would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all timeI am dreading on my next return flight back to LondonVery poor customer serviceI checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can I have aisle seat and she just said noIn the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don\xe2\x80\x99t have space and you can put that underneath your seatI told him I don\xe2\x80\x99t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian foodOur flight from Seattle to London in November 6th was canceled due to technical problemsAfter waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the BA associate couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find us any immediate flightI would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive The customer relation phone number is disconnectedAfter 1.5 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them.It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honestMy first impression was how badly the "new" 1st Class is holding upThere are scuff marks everywhereThey looked like they had been pinched from a graveyardIt is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offerTotally, utterly boringThe cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you\'d expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is betterThe world\'s most hated Business Class in the skyFor breakfast I requested the same and I was refusedHe said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came backI felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing.Booked our return flight in Business/Club Class (at \xc2\xa31,000+ each) only to find BA want to charge an extra \xc2\xa380 each to choose our seats Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tinPoor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told "We only do that in First class - ifwe did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that"times, a sort of sleep deprivation tortureIf you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed.I\'m hugely disappointed with the Business class tripService is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutesThe drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusiveIf you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all overDont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of itThe "new releases" is a contradiction in termsI would not recommend BA to anyone.In contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factorCabin crew were adequate rather than outstandingThe dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flightsMy IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous monthOne of the worst business class experienceEntertainment system didn\'t work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solutionService super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengersFood bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgustingA disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn\'t been properly cleaned for daysPoor service and an entertainment system from a different ageI have avoided flying with BA for the last 20 years, now I remember whyAvoid them if your route allows.Very unimpressive amenities and serviceUnless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over youThe food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to getMy husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn\'t get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine)I, on the other hand never got the main courseI finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked.They are not giving free food and drinks anymore, you have to pay on short haulThey are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because \'the flights are too busy\'Avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used toI have no problem with BA turning into a budget airline, but at least charge accordingly, otherwise, it feels like we\'re being scammed.The journey from Malaysia to Mexico alone for business trip would be very boringBA are going downhill an extremely rude steward that I could like it or lump it basicallyHe said I should have put my requests on my account but you can\xe2\x80\x99t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect them only The snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bunTotally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worseThe light didn\xe2\x80\x99t work on my seat so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my TV, watching was incredibly hardI won\xe2\x80\x99t be travelling with them again if at all possible.Arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hoursNo complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delayDespite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respondThis airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements BA\'s transformation into an overpriced EasyJetWill not fly with them again.On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much longerAs British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their servicesThis has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfatherIn addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever encountered I am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor I will fly with them in the future.The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90\xe2\x80\x99s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used toPremium Economy on BA is a jokeNo hot food/drink; awfulThe extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obeseBA Premium Economy - forget itThe bag drop process took an hour even though I had checked in alreadyThe staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about thisStaff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apologyAnother flight attendant didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshmentsNot exactly best of British, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly not be recommending! On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into LondonFirst they said you did not buy any upgraded seatYou can\'t get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seatThey saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can\'t get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premiumThe change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flightThis is miserable customer service.Absolutely disgusted with BAThis has proven too difficultThe bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduledI rejected BA\'s offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraftWhen I booked in the window seat selections had been lostMy husband and I were forced to sit separatelyAt the booking in I was told that they could not find "proof" that I had paid for selected seatsI could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flightsSpooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip I plannedOn the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my TV did not workThe staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seatCompletely inadequate service by BA (not the flight attendants) in delivering the flights I paid for and dealing with the complaints.The booking process was not smooth and very stressful, I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call centerAll the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, I\'m sure thatwas annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.The cabin crew service was below standardI had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was watching a movieI  noticed that if you didn\'t have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anythingAirplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I was hungryThe connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to HeathrowIt looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a USB portCabin crew service on this leg was  below standardI\'m probably to blame because I overrated BA before flying with them but now I know better.I\'m convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several yearsThe food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizzaThe choice of food leaves a lot to be desiredThe flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seatsYou couldn\'t even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I\'m not bigThe recliner didn\'t work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seatI feel sorry for larger peopleThe food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinksThe flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 1:30Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts onThen the customer service has been very uselessSuch a very bad experienceI do not recommend flying with them.Amsterdam to London arrived 33 minutes late - three delays, taking off, landing, and getting the walkway to the airplaneThis has happened twice this yearI fly British on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayedThe plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable, there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke SpanishThe bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy, During the night no water was offered to meBusiness Class space is ridiculously narrowService is very carelessYou are not allowed laptops on the flight from Riyadh, so you cannot work if you want toDuring check-in using the BA app, there was a problem that I had to re-start, after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing meWhat a rip off for a short flightI would not recommend this airlineThis is the strictest airline I have ever usedIn-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a mealYou don\'t get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinksCustomer service: From the get go the customer service was appallingIt is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressfulThey wouldn\'t allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn\'t go onAt the airport, they couldn\'t find my children\'s booking which caused further delay and stressHow do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn\'t do anything to help changeDon\'t bother flying BA.I wanted to drink water, but the cabin crew does not accepted my requestNo food was served, except some M&S, BBC news was playing on the screens, with no sound and Russian captions, quite confusingI am not a fan if the BA configuration in BusinessI am not sure where to beginFood awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of itWine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine listEntertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of optionsStaff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business beforeDisengaged and disinterestedThe cabin was over hill for meThe toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish binI would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations.Although a BA flight, this sector was operated by Air Belgium and offered a really poor experienceAircraft felt old and tired, cabin crew were totally indifferent, cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedibleA really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future.Disgusting and had to force them to cleanNo entertainment on board, it was not functionalWhen I complained to BA they told me I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t communicate with the CEO but I could connect with their customer relationsI have been Gold on BA for thirty years and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to ditch this \r\nnon responsive airline.complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff, and also includeMy only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tediousI upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA\xe2\x80\x99s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointedWhile the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guestsBA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lackingBecause of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortableBA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the serviceI will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another optionThey were as always let down by their Iberia partners in that their Madrid business lounge was abysmal as usualWith no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tablesOnce boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by 40 minutesOther than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required. Waiting at gate, the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too highAir conditioning problem on boardThe departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expectedOnly downside was deplaning in PHL where F passengers had to fight their way off through the J scrum - could have been controlled by crew, but was not.I did not like the mealsI was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but I found noneThe fast track security was non existantTotal experience was bad.14 day trip to play golf with my Father, and BA lost my clubs for 7 daysDealing with BA lost luggage/customer service was brutal, they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it would take to retrieve themFlight home from LHR-YYZ was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion, and a broken seat that wouldn\'t stay uprightThe IFE system badly needs upgrading, and no power ports at the seats - grueling 7.5hr flightAs bad as I thought Air Canada was they are light years ahead of BA.I was shocked that BA provides buy onboard short haul flights - no free water, coffee or teaI tried to buy something but my Credit Card wouldn\'t work, and I could not pay with cash.I have seen a change for the worst in BA service, and it does not seem to get any betterThe rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new thingsOn some flights Champagne is not being served when you have taken your seatThey seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than Gordon\'sBooked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional \xc2\xa3180 for our two seatsNever expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days beforeWe were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premiumThe steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces offAfter a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardessesI bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sentthem a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problemsWe have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club EuropeBut with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pileNever again, BA club world offered is a farce in today\'s business market.As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA\'s customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on thisMy issue was with faulty equipment onboardIssue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praiseAsked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hittingmy head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisationFollowing a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don\'t wish to deal with issue when something goes wrongI now have 91000 Avios going to waste as my business will be going else where.Worst airline I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever dealt withBritish Airways lost my and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s luggage on our vacationThey have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issueThey have ruined our vacation and refuse to help usPlease, never book this airline.I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hoursOn the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins lateMy wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped andsome were out of serviceWe tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get throughMy wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me inIt was a computer glitch we couldn\'t get around Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check inMy wife was ok and could go through but I could notWe asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn\'t help usThey then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn\'t reschedule usI am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbsShe was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressedThe attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any wayAfter reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn\'t believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sendingNothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in RomeWe eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British AirwaysLike any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support.Terminal 5 is rubbishThe crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to themin just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bagThe flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no choice.When I checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me \xe2\x82\xac70 as compare to \xe2\x82\xac35Afterwards I phoned customer care to discuss the issue, customer care agent has dropped my call three timesHe was not helpful at all, then I asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager, they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said managerThis is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathyBritish Airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggageUnfortunately, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be flying again with British Airways due to this awkward behavior.The South lounge was rammedWe took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfastComing home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm AliDowned a couple of G&TsThe seating is still hopelessThe every day fare price is ludicrous.Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayedMy 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morningBecause of the late timing, I was charged $356USDThen after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had bookedIs there any other airline that doesn\'t simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? I will never flyThe seats were the biggest let downWhilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar supportThe headrest did not move at alla missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of spaceWe arrived safely but our bags did notIt is now Monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous one we are still without our bagsCome on BA sort this shambles out.Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad signBrindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengersThere was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anythingSadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese \'courses\' reduced to microscopic portionsIt\'s just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.Despite booking and paying for seats with BA this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on the A380 which are dreadful seats byFor the first time in many years I found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had runWent through 3 layers of customer service with BA on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed offPlane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg.The flight was on time and the machine clean and? They do not serve free water, let alone tea or coffeeWhile this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customersBA simply turned into a low cost airline.No entertainment eitherI was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt crampedI was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirtyThere was grime around the USB port (which didn\'t work), tv screen and along the floor by the wallI found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in responseThe main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointingThe First Wing at Terminal 5 was rubbish tonight, 20 or so deep and it\xe2\x80\x99s really the only decent part of BA\xe2\x80\x99s ground operationFlight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at Kennedy made us overall lateBA\'s first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn\'t the same price and reward tickets are readily available if youI cant really fault any of itIFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,Wifi was available but the page to connect didn\'t load up when i tried itLeft my luggage behind on the belt by mistake30 mins after I realised I went back to the airport but no British Airways staff was willing to helpDialed for BA baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered againThis is so frustrating.The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact, I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soonWe weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting the long queue for Club Europe check-in, but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in T5It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see the point of BA\xe2\x80\x99s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate.The majority of the time my seat choice is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than the normal queue, and the lounges so overcrowded that it\'s sometimes hard toThe Iberia lounge at Madrid is equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfastBritish Airways is a rip offThis seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the othersI recently travelled on Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal BA/Iberia are by comparison.Initial flight from London cancelled from under us 3 days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrivalTotal chaosGround service appalling and no free service on boardCheckin from Hamburg appallingly slow, and didn\'t open until 2 hrs from departureAll in all an unsatisfactory airline.Flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board TV screen tiny and poor choices of entertainmentAfter so much disappointing experience with BA, this was finally a nice flightI did not purchase any food, but I saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on-board purchases.I fly with BA on a regular basis and am a gold card holder, their service attitude and facilities drop lower and lowerThe planes are filthy, not cleaned properly between flights, the staff are hit and miss - but more miss than anything and very poorly turned outThe food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable - and as for customer service, there is no point in ringing them theyare useless, rude, hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever.They wanted to charge me an extra GBP65 for being over the 23kg limitThe legroom seemed very small to me, the flight was super full and I was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seatBoeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly badUnfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27CThe crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfyingBA started to do a buy-on-board service which I hateOur flight was delayed from Rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to Los Angeles as we landed in Heathrow 20 minutes before theThere were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrowThey put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff.However the food is really poorIn the last 12 months I have had some of the worst airline food served from BA or Cathay Pacific and this includes my most recent travels with British AirwaysSince I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worseThe only thing that you get is an empty middle seatThe meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pieThe on board service, is less \'attentive\' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable)Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properlyAt some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlinesTickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small,there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays)What is that makes BA in European flights distinct? Probably nothing.Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the foodNot the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodiumAttendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed upSandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendousHummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the leastOur flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing mealBefore landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crewI thought British Airways was better than this.The seat cushion was so badly sunken it was as if totally unpaddedLuggage was mislaid for 33 hours, even with priority tagshoddy serviceDuring the flight, I was asked by stewardess if I would like any food - I find that approach not pleasant at allI was not personally invited to use the LoungeI find that lacking for a business class fare.Both flights faced 1 hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination Worst business class experience and totally disappointed.Food was ok \xe2\x80\x93 but the drinks choices remain poorWater and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO LondonFast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foulsalty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetablesThe salad is a nonsense \xe2\x80\x93 a few leaves and a tomato slicePudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was grossHowever the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from workingI continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is(BA should be embarrassed that it\xe2\x80\x99s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bagsFast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security \xe2\x80\x93 even in the fast track laneletter which results in a slow and impersonal serviceThe food is truly awful \xe2\x80\x93 both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lagI do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seatAfter the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, ifOf course the usual BA Club Class "scramble over the legs" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today\'s competitive Business ClassMuch more up to date touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of "blockbuster" filmsAs usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down bythe appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seatEspecially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth itIt\'s irritating that they don\'t have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn\'t amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, onlyDepartures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runwayA very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?)But it\'s certainly nothing special for First ClassAppalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer servicemade me doubt the authenticity of the mealNeedless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan mealsWhen she returned she said \'We don\'t provide that sort of thing." That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you didSo we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not workThe Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed offAfter several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another waySo we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UKdisappointed with BA, that no lounge access was availableOn arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor showBA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like totravel with a \'full service\' airline and in this case BA were lacking.There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of waterThe plane itself was old, I found the food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptopsBecause we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the planeBritish Airways need to improve their service levels.Bad service and attitude all roundMy fiasco was when my flight from London was cancelled due to failure of their systemsBA refused to rebook us at the airport, instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to Milan viaBA are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel, food and refreshment costs We were stranded at the airport, no help to find a hotel, zero customer care or empathyThe frittata on breakfast wasn\'t good, howeverI didn\'t like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early)a Premium Product in the present circumstances, is it? Absolutely terrible In Flight Entertainment system - although it was On Demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system:blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies...But the main drawback with BA is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to \xc2\xa3105 Not what I expect from a flag carrier airlinegot more and more delayedI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fineBA\'s service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight\'s experience really takes the biscuitWe boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or soShortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking offOne more hour in, we were told airspace was shut againWe were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flightwad cancelledLittle was I to know that the real disaster was still to comeHowever, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthyThis is beyond unbelievableNo assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situationThe feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is brokenThis is all simply appallingBut to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not onWhy they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not knowAnd as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this badBA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the "we don\'t workBy contrast, I don\'t see how BA could have handled this worseFlight crew don\'t afford old fashioned courtesy or serviceI\'m not saying they are rude, just that they don\'t provide a decent level of customer serviceNo bags at the other end on arrival which I guess you have to live with, however the way they deal with it is appallingCouldn\'t care less I feel3hr delay on return flightsSeems BA is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender.I almost missed my flight because at check-in I had to complete some really important papers that took 40 minutes -  later, no one asked me for those papersBut the plane had no paid Wi-Fi, no outlets or USB ports, the screens were low quality.never fly BA given the current productThe cabin was old, cramped and dirtyThe cabin crew were abrupt and surlyThe buy-on-board is still a massive bug-bear - we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary.A delayed BA flight by 55 minsOld airplane, unhelpful staffDelays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delaysAnother terrible show from British Airways.However, the in flight product has deteriorated - salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers - had to have sandwichSeats dirty and no middle seat tray although business classReally disorganized at boarding - calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed upOn arrival no bags and trying to get update but no updateTrying to get update on baggage after 12 hours but no update.BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only justConsidering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pathetic offeringFood was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates availableWhilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for thisat one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else\xe2\x80\x99s seatI was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I wasBA don\xe2\x80\x99t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete,there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentationThe flight from Jeddah to Heathrow wasn\'t as good as I expected, ground staff at Jeddah some of them were rudeAlso, the new baggage restriction for the flights to the UK made the trip uncomfortable, I had to check my carry-on bag at the gate because my laptop charger and I won\'t fly with BA again until they change their baggage restrictions for the Saudi flights.Not only planes are delayed (as today), but the lounges in Heathrow are a jokeI don\'t use them anymore as they are overcrowded, and they don\'t serve proper food, just snacksTheir customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requestsThe only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly.Crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese (including sandwiches) not good when someone cannot eat cheeseBreakfast usual offering OK but not really worth the money paidI found the seats weren\'t wide enough and leg room was restrictedOn the way back to London the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room I had to moveBaggage self-check-in was diabolical ..machines were either slow or not workingHowever the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poorI don\'t expect a meal but even a drink of water would have been somethingFlew premium economy and the experience was anything butUnsurprisingly slow process, and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in lineNo smile, no \'Hello\' or \'Good morning\'If anything, the situation was worse at boardingSome attempted to board prematurely more than onceAccepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.I booked my flight online about 3 months ahead of my planned travel date and thought I would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in theI arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a Salzburg coffee shopIt was outrageous of British Airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when I checked in at LHR on the 05/07How dare BA do this to me when I was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work (different airlines) until I encountered BA at HeathrowCheck-in and help desk are arrogant, rude and are as miserable as hellNot even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a \xc2\xa35 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you haveBritish Airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the Heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, theyare wrong, like others I have found an alternative airlineI close my review and say I will never ever use British Airways againI would rather walk to Manchester.Lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and I not sitting togetherThere will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what groups are travelling and do t care whereBA bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this.Luggage broken into \xe2\x80\x93 no explanationNot so goodThe bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangementThe trust breakerMine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further useBA have not provided any explanation despite queries to Customer Relations; this is not acceptableCorporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff.The cabin looked so old and tired, I struggle to understand why BA has not updated yet on a lot of their B777 aircraftThe meal service commenced 2 and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this pointThe option I wanted ran out by the time they got to me and I wasn\'t even sitting in the last rows of the economy section The seats were very uncomfortableHaving booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the BA website aWhy didn\'t BA notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight? Once we\'d boarded we found that there was oneThe plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes lateWhen we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing aroundThe service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and datedThe return flight was a disasterThe seats were dirty, food was like rubber, plane was dated, seats smelt, Lauren Perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason, some new policy apparently and again wehad upgraded people in first which is not greatWhen I complained I was offered 8,000 Avios, are you serious BA? I think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much betterBritish Airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty - it\xe2\x80\x99s about time they had a deep clean and re-model the first classHad four flights in total with this airline, first flight from Dublin to London on 29th June 2018 was delayed by 2 hoursThis delay would have meant we missed our connection in Heathrow to Miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs (no reason or apologies)By the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cabOur flights home to Dublin via Heathrow were fine until we reached Dublin and realised they had lost our bagDespite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day (it was put on the wrong plane - again no apologies given for this inconvenience)We are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing outSeems like no one caresBritish Airways are not doing us proudTheir web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance, but I was charged \xc2\xa365 to bring my bike backThe check in staff were very forceful and abruptWhen I got back I contacted their customer service, they are not willing to help Also, the seats are getting really uncomfortableThe food is terrible.The queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 minsGroup boarding was super slowInside the econ cabin, the plane seemed very old, and worn-outThe entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn\'t inform the customers about itSome of the flight attendants were unprofessionalMeals were bad for me, the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste goodThe wifi doesn\'t exist in the cabin.British Airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business classNo co-ordination at airport and apparently not one BA manager at Rome airport who I could speak toHad to call BA customer service in UK which was a waste of timeFailed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slowAdvised stewardess but they did not careCould not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seatWaste of time paying to go business class with BAAfter sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl wasDisappointing experienceI wouldn\'t book business class again, felt like bad value for moneyI expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn\'t see an upgrade incomparison to the huge extra costThe staff weren\'t that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the endThe staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of moneyReally not worth it!Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of theIt is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlinesWhen we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridgeRight from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flightBecause I need special assistance they didn\'t have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do itclosed and he said nonsenseMy wife says thanks for the unnecessary stressThat means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed bySo for me the seat was below my expectationThe food was just OK nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choiceIn my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who don\'t have snobs working for them.BA First Class is not even that any morePoor food, average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with LH facilities in FRA or MUCThere is no ground assistance, and boarding was haphazardBA, your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you, and your First Class product is not worth the name anymoreAnd no wi-fiThe morning of the departure I received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled, with no specified reasonDisappointed of the disservice I called the customer service in England (and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator) and I was offereda flight in the evening at 1900, which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declinedI had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to London in time, unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that costOn top of it, since the flight would arrive no longer at Heathrow but at Stansted, I had to pay the taxi \xc2\xa370 more than the agreed amount if IBritish Airways did not take responsibility, I was not reimbursed the new flight I had to book last minute nor the taxi differenceThey did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress causedThe worst has been the answer of their customer Care saying it was not their responsibility!Bag has been lost for 48 hoursThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t even answer my email! My wife and I have had the same clothes on our backs since we left JFKWe have missed out on eventsWe can\xe2\x80\x99t get into certain places due to dress codesHorrible, horrible serviceIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost 1 pm the next day and the bag still isn\xe2\x80\x99t here!Sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poorThe staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be thereThe person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loadedThere was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choiceI had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - noEventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyableWe were not given anythingThe service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlinesVery disappointing experience - flew out on a 747 400 series (should be scrapped!) Departed lateLoaded aircraft ready for push back, no a/c Temperature was excessively hot all flight, no cool airPersonal Media system broken, split screenFood quality diabolicalMoody flight attendants, ran out of hand soapBeen flying BA for over 25 years, probably would be a last choice in future - sad to see.Seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittentlyWe paid extra for World Traveller Plus but I consider that we were connedCustomer services have been useless and on the second time of writing I received the following response, "Thanks for coming back to usI completely understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t offer you our full catering service, especially as on such a long haul flightI hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their cateringThis meant they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide a full meal service and I absolutely agree this isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you would expect when you travel with usI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry we\xe2\x80\x99ve let you down." That is itThis is the last time we will ever book long haul with you.But if I have to be realistic, it\xe2\x80\x99s very old, loud and uncomfortableThe service isn\xe2\x80\x99t good either, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even get a cup of waterThe plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your headHorrible old seats with no padding and very dirtyService was a lot slower as they announced they had less staffIFE was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choiceI wouldnt fly BA again if I had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats\xc2\xa3210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensiveAlso the planes they use are too old and tatty.Most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new Boeing 787I found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generallyaverage economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft I have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747BA needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulationThis felt to me more like being crammed in to a Boeing 737 on a transatlantic flight.What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don\'t seem toIt is a rip-offThe forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a windowBA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceledIt turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch upAll they said is we can\'t help youI kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economywas awfulFood was terribleThere were no good seats leftWhich meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hoursI have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selectionget our refunds.They wouldn\'t refundCalled again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could doDon\'t ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer serviceThey have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent\'s can\'t or won\'t do anything but sell seatsI spoke to many many supervisors, no resultsThere is no one to solve problemsThey pass the buck, have you fill out forms online and no one responds.Seats and everything was comfy enough, although my girlfriends television didn\'t work for either the outbound or inbound flight, and little effort was made for a resolutionissue! On the flight from Gatwick to Tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 30-40 minutes as the bridge \'wasn\'t where it should be\' which once again wasn\'tthe worst problem In the world but after a long flight isn\'t particularly what you wanted! It wasn\'t the best experience.\r\nBA\xe2\x80\x99s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choicesChampagne was conspicuously lackingThere were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to boardFAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasmThe food was the worst we\'ve ever experienced in Club WorldThe \'smoked chicken salad\' was atrocious and the \'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap\' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrorsThe White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in advertsThere\'s little one can do to remedy a hard seatOverall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class productBritish Airways are falling ever behind their competitors.I  fly other long haul flights and none of BA\xe2\x80\x99s competitors are providing such low quality entertainment I used to think of British Airways as being a premium airline - now they\xe2\x80\x99re just rubbish.The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nastyOn time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up)No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn\'t explain why it\'s not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable(and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dryAwful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landingThe only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud andannoyingWorst experienceTerrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism, they offered \xc2\xa325 voucher and no apology - an insult as did not ask for compensationIt\'s an expensive price to pay for a low cost airlineOur original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise shipThis was not a lot of good when our car was parked at GatwickThe following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes lateThis was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was servedThe real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/AviosThis simply does not workI consider this to be completely unacceptableIf this is the level of service we can now expect from British Airways, there is no point traveling with themIn comparison, BA offers a very low standardThe flight attendant who served the section where I was seated couldn\'t have cared lessNo greetings when passengers boarded the plane, no offer of helpHe asked for my drink order but never delivered the drinkThe toilet hadn\'t been cleaned properly before boarding, and during the flight, one of the two washrooms became unusable, resulting in long queuesThe seating arrangement - having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction- is uncomfortableOverall, appalling quality and little value for money.While in Bucharest I sustained a fall and although I wasn\'t seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggageBA European service is becoming like an expensive low cost airlineThe price of seat selection still remains highThe seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2-hour flightDue to poor weather conditions at LHR, the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandableThen, no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their ownOnce on board, the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hourThe flight finally takes off nearly three hours lateThe flight arrived in Istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury, the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal.Flying first class with British Airways is a hit-or-miss affairUnfortunately, Terminal 3 isn\'t the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour - or decent champagnesThe food on offer is adequate, although hardly first classThe IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgradeThe FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong jobOverall, a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane.Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 perTheir Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium classAll the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what I call a premium loungeThe BA gate in the dreadful E terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairsPeople jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sectionsThe seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpetThe flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this Miami flight does not dock in terminal 5In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottomTheir Avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlinesTry using BA points on American or Cathay or even Alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try.Rubbish check-in service, as bad as RyanairOne bag was over 23 kg (27/28), they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me I will risk myself to miss the flight and not able toThey were so rude and unhelpfulBoarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant mannerFlight was delayed without the checked-in agent saying anything, after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather2 hrs before flight they cancelled it without rebooking or explanationThere is not a hotline to call.BA\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been declining for years so I don\xe2\x80\x99t use themI did and they lost it7 hours later no luggage or idea where it isRidiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good willLagging significantly behind EasyJet in all aspects.Desperately poor service from British Airways in Club ClassBusiness Class is utterly outdated, with the weird "facing each-other configuration", and narrow / uncomfortable seatsThe food served was appallingThe cabin crew were inattentive at best, and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer serviceThe problem with British Airways now in First and Business Class, is what they are completely lacking: namely, any class or manners whatsoeverPoor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible / small movie screens, No WIFI and an overall budget airline experienceBritish Airways even charge for seat selection too, which adds insult to injuryAvoid this horrible airline if you canA shame BA ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude.When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can\xe2\x80\x99t check in online which I now understand is also incorrectOnly after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and\xe2\x80\x98Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!\xe2\x80\x99 After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can\xe2\x80\x99t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manageroffered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flightFast forward to the gate \xe2\x80\x93 utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tearsAs this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit anywhere near each otherhere is on the wrong flight\xe2\x80\x99! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not anempty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to get off here and my children in tearsSeparate complaint raised to CAA about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seatConclusion is families avoid at all costs.Paris to Newark, flight cancelledThis experience was one of the worst I\xe2\x80\x99ve hadThe engineers had no idea what was wrong with the engine, all air and water shut off for three hoursThe flight attendants did not keep us updatedWill never fly British airways againShe wouldn\'t call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitchToday is 17 days with no response and my money still not refundedI\'ll never fly with them again.time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particularLeg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen wasso small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anythingI declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offeredBA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again.As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problemThe food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantlyBA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in betweenOne guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserableThat is sad given the stature of BAHard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.The years have not been kind to BAThe problem is not the hard productNosier than the A380 but that is well knownIt is the soft product that is lackingNow its just a lack of polish with the soft productI know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas)It\'s just the quality that is lackingThis is available on Qantas but no sir, we don\'t serve thatA note about the FA\'s: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked toA touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically badA sick flight attendant so just one female attendant handled aloneThere was no machine to print a card, queue taking 75 minutes to get boarding card, and several people were too late for check inWhile British Airways is more or less in the same price range as Lufthansa, no complimentary food or drinks were servedThe departure was from Terminal 1 in Munich, which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal 2And arrival at Terminal 5 in Heathrow which is not as nice/easy as the new Star alliance Queens Terminal 2No WiFi, personal device entertainment or onboard monitors on my flightSeat reservation too expensive in my eyesThe flight was not very fullDated aircraft, very poor cabin service, semi inedible food and the inevitable entertainment system crash made for a very poor journeyThe cabin crew clearly regarded us as an intrusion and I do not feel that I should be having to ask for a drink with my main meal, surely weI used to be happy to pay more to fly BA, now I pay extra not to.This time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped (hot towels as you neared your destination), and they have become almost a low fare airlineThe seating on the Boeing 787 seemed very crampedOn the return flight on May 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of serviceThe A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hardThey may be the new "slimline" seats, I\'m not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flightThey aren\'t worth any extra cost.Apart from the space, nothing nothing was First class, not even the comfortFood which used to be fantastic is just eatable, no moreAnd my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved meAnd an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizingNeedless to say no wifi! Apart from their LHR First and Concorde Room lounges at LHR which remain great, BA is now no better than a 3 star airlineSad for the clients and shameful for BA management.I was told that clearing border control would be done at final destination at Glasgow, but this was not trueThe woman at the counter asked me where I was going and when I said Montreal, she looked at me and said "you won\'t make it"Imagine my shock after spending an additional $1500 CAD all inWhen I escalated my complaint, they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you, and that was that.I didn\'t like the seats on the 777I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of youThe meal was a joke and there was no choiseInflight entertainment is not up to date, small screens with low brightnessThe crew was not very friendlyThe second meal service was rushedThere\'s nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been niceUnfortunately BA decided to cut the the service on European flights in the race to the bottom.The food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwichesOne passenger wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea wasBusiness class was quite average to be honestFreezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep \xe2\x80\x93 another example of BA\xe2\x80\x99s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airlineI\'ll be sticking to easyJet until British Airways once again starts to value it\xe2\x80\x99s passengers, as currently they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less.BA are a disgrace, it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag highMy flight from Islay was delayed by 2 hours, no fault of mine, so I missed my connecting flight! After being fobbed off as not my fault, nothing we cando I ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again, I had to pay for another flightMoney grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feelingThe poorest part of the trip is the TV being so small and picture so poorIn the end, couldn\'t really use it as it was so frustrating amongst other operational issues i.eVery disappointed in British AirwaysHaving been delayed by a "partner airline" and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve, BA charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morningTheir system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my BA exec club membership so I\'d had to book it as two flightsNeither BA or Loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the nightClearly, being a member of the BA exec club counts for nothingVery bad customer service BASeems BA and Loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers.The only complaint I have is about the ground staff at HeathrowI lost my jacket on the Shanghai to London flight and ground staff at Heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects.I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungryI chose BA because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ATH to LHR they do not serve food and beverages freeI was disappointed with BA especially with their decision to charge for F&B on European flights.The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with CathayThe seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very crampedThe food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very toughUnderstand BA plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough.I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the foodBA business class is really dated, and I said it felt crampedMy BIG issue, and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely BA\xe2\x80\x99s fault was the over zealous security screening at HeathrowI was pulled aside for screening 3 timesI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessiveHamburg to Heathrow not even a free glass of water or a candyEverything is for purchase, I felt cheatedGetting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over 1hr within the same terminal! Security screening was extremely slow and staff rudeI will avoid Heathrow in the futureMy feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to beGranted they only loaded one of the wine options (which was wasn\'t great either)Food itself not terribly appetizingBreakfast quite rushed, which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flightAn average experienceThe 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft, even though I paid for premium economy the seat was hard, small and uncomfortable, it would not recline withoutthe air stewardess yanking the seat back, the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid offThe touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely workingThe washroom had a leak and when I used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks, the air stewardess justThe  crew appeared bored and not bothered.The staff were clear that it is BA policy that bags cannot be fastened togetherI have had several replies in that time but on each occasion, the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check inBA has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact BA employees or employed by a third partyThis is very disappointing in what was a reputable company.My flight from Singapore was delayed in the air and I was not allowed onto my connecting flightAfter 3 weeks, they finally mailed back to say they would refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket, but I was not entitled to any even tokengesture of Frequent Flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat, after a long haul flightI missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleepIt was all handled very poorly, late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via Air France or one of the middle east carriersIts left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and I will certainly look at flying with other carriers now.Massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like Ryanair or Easyjet with no real added valueNo drinks or food served on the flight, the check-in process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage asA bit more legroom but that won\xe2\x80\x99t justify the \xc2\xa3200 price difference on a 2hr flight.When called, British airways most unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them even though I bought the ticket from ba.com and had one flight number BA2058A shocking attitude towards their paying customer.Worst BA flight ever! Flew Tampa to London GatwickDirty planeOnly once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced, which is a clear indication that delay was known earlierProbably the worst business class seat around, wobbly footrest, facing strangers and having to climb over peopleNever again.Food terribleEven worse was the seatThe I saw no food in the Iberia lounge at Madrid, no working washrooms, and discourteous Iberia staffThe food on board was ludicrous, in business I got a panini - the staff looked embarrassed to serve itWaste of money.It is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptableI cannot fly during the day as I have meetings scheduledBA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the dayMoreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that BA is offering during the dayThey also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or clubIn Summary it is unacceptable that BA is charging more for the flights with Club World Seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for likeI recently flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of thisThe plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were surlySeat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flightThe food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portionWhilst AA is improving, BA is becoming a national embarrassmentBA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selectionThe seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlinesIt no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 starIt\'s not even worth redeeming Avios points anymoreSame food, same drinks, same slow wifiI like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in businessThe food service was disappointingI have travelled a lot with BA over the past 20 years, after yesterda I have lost my faith in British Airways.You simply can\xe2\x80\x99t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket priceFor that price there is no airbridge (you will wait on a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 hour flightAlso, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad)It seems to be the same all overBA used to be a first choice but at this price, for this service, it\xe2\x80\x99s become a last resort.Premium economy worse than most airlines economyUnprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operateRubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flyingThese \xe2\x80\x9cpremium economy\xe2\x80\x9d seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loosOther airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BAEven the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeupI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a good experience.Stressful day started with a 2.5 hours delay for the morning flight at 7amThe online check-in would not work for me in accordance with the One World Frequent flyer policyThe BA website would not let me do soThe bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather randomBoarding was tediousBoarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggageThe cabin crew were quite indifferentOne of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been rippedDisembarkation was slow and badly managedBA has become a low-cost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag I will not be using them again inBA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost faresNot value for moneyStaff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes thereBoarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a numberSeats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLubTheir lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor qualityIt is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn\'t fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business classBA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airlineThe changes on baggage weight has become silly alsoIn my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to BrazilThumbs down to BA.I had an extra bag that I paid $200 for in Dallas, our flight got delayed in Dallas, therefore we missed our flight to LagosThey refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy, I know this, but what happened was not my fault, but theirsThat was the last time I heard from them on the issue, even the economy premium was a waste of money, nothing special, such a disappointment, never again!Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever had (and I travel often)How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I woulddelay the flight if the bags had to be offloadedI have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean "thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyoneWhat a sad state of affairsI will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haulI would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.The air conditioning didn\xe2\x80\x99t work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hotOverall the airplane was old with little space to seatThere was no wi-fiIf your child doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like spicy or flavored foods/snacks, there would be nothing to eatAlso the Airport Security was overly zealous - they had to search kids bag, and they found roll-on deodorant and checked it for fumes.My bag was damaged on a BA flight in December 2017They will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly usedI raised this with BA who refused to offer like-for-like replacementI got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times4 months later I decide that something is better than nothing and call K2, to get the bag they offered me, only to find that BA have closed my caseand they won\'t send oneI would not fly again unless I had no other viable option.waste of moneyThe cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn\'t clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and foodwere average at bestWhy in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat wasadequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any responseOn top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and itseemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don\'t expect to have to remind the flight attendant aboutSecurity staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officiousBoarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyanceThe wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoySeats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seatOverall, an adequate flight, but the inflight experience was well below BA\'s competitors.It\'s bad that BA requests additional payment to select seats before the check-inToilets in the second half of the flight weren\'t too cleanThe aircraft did not have WiFi.Disappointed at BA - flights were delayed (my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 2-3hrs)Aircraft interior was outdated, unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom spaceNo safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include thisFood was tasteless and I did skip a meal in the end - during one of the snack times we weren\'t given the options by our FA but the guyInflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very oldTo ensure that I sit with my partner on the return flight, we paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroomspace for my partner was obstructed by a broke IFE box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cablesI am a disabled traveller with considerable mobility issuesAs I usually travel alone I can find it extremely difficultHaving used other airlines in the past - I am converted - I will not use any other airline in future.The cabin crews were slow at taking paymentCheckout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for theOnboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointingUpon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrongI asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what waswrong givenUnfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TVHad a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I\'ve had in some Business class)Once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not workingThe cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working eitherThere was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve thisAs BAs safety demonstration prior to take off is on video, we didn\'t receive thisThe flight was the worst airline experience we\'ve hadI doubt I\'ll ever fly with BA again.The plane was not very clean, grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seatsThe return was poorly organised, no use of fast track security for business class passengersLong queue for boarding and a grubby planeReally no point in paying for business classThe staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment, dog-eared magazinesTheir customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchyFor background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BAThis then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it\'s nottheir problemTAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flightHowever, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shiftThey were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of BAThis is very rude and extremely unprofessionalDue to the snowy weather, my flight leaving Berlin to London was delayed, in which I was worried about missing my connecting flight from London to Hong KongDidn\'t expect this from British AirwaysFor me quality hit the rock bottomEspecially the unclean flightMaybe my expectations was too high but considering the price I paid for ticket I think it\'s not worth itOther airline which I used to travel had the same price and if I compare the services of that ariline I regret choosing British Airways.From September 2018, the Gatwick fleet will be \'densified\', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced Club Worldof schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that\'s commonplace at Fort Lauderdale terminal 4The service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at BA I am flying with them very frequently and this last trip was testament that they have lost passionThe response was we are not responsible for cleaning the plane.\r\nI thought service in the sky had died outAs a frequent flyer I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt the needed to complain nor commend until nowDuring the dinner, I was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awakeInstead of them explaining and apologising, I had to ask where is my foodThey said that they ran out of food, because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleepis not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hoursIt was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes, and out it came a cabin crewWorst business class I flew, you are facing a stranger for the entire flightAlso every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me, i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my faceDreadful food, a very dated 777 plane and  uninterested staffThe bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people aretaking too much foodThey also ran out of the appetiserI was told sorry, we ran out of satay, and other passengers have already ordered themI tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working, this was also disappointingWith regards to the service on board the flight, it was ok, however, they collected my breakfast card, but not my husbands, so he nearly missed out on breakfast, thenext morning, they offered my husband a bread roll, but not me, it seemed there was not much structure to the service, which meant they missed thingsThe worst long haul carrier I have flown withA very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policyThe flights served the worst foodThe seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into myMeals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8+ hoursWhen i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landingStaff overall were uninterested and unhelpfulThe dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens.The cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengersMy email to their CEO produced nothing except a plastic apology, even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocationTerminal 5 Concorde Room is impressive, clean but lacks serviceHad to wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attendWhen it comes to meal choice, the main course I had selected (non veg Indian dish) was not availableWhen questioned why? - I was told, "sorry, today we only loaded 3 of those dishes, and other passengers have already ordered themIt is shame that BA is flying with less than 50% food choice for their premium passengersI have never faced this situation with Virgin or Emirate, and have decided never to fly with BA if I can help.Worn seats, cracks in the walls and dirtyAdditonally, the IFE did not workNo IFE and no book reading possibleCrew were young and friendly, but obviously not experiencedNeeded to wait 20 minutes until someone arrivedOverall, poor experience with British AirwaysWill not workTo fly, to serve is no more adequate as their slogan.WAW is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control \xe2\x80\x9cBolero\xe2\x80\x9d is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airportSeat in club Europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch - frankly it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with suchFor a 2.5 hour flight, they do not offer anything free on board, there was no individual screen or USB charge at the seat for this short European flight.Uneventful flightMy problem with BA, for a while now, is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights.Was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight?Chicago check in staff unfriendly, it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of usThe only thing they tried was to upsell me into First ClassHe asked for drinks menu - answer - "What do you want?"  The seat was claustrophobic,  closed and uncomfortableThe crew was unsmiling.They have recently introduced the new Club World service on this route and it was a complete disasterIt took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flightThey ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served coldThe cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clientsOverall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA concept doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight)Food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll, which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and aUpon arrival at terminal 3 for check in I was disappointed to see no separate check injust a young girl with a couldn\'t care less attitude behind a temporary room dividerOff we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the door, huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long timeThe lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not goodOn board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn\'t stay up and aOur return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is stillopen at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm restFlying in BA\'s Club Europe is a miserable experience, and I think they have the lowest standard of all European airlinesService and food are mediocreWhen will BA get its act together and return to acceptable standards?This time I had to fly from Edinburgh to London Gatwick and I end up with mix feelingsThe plane was an Airbus 319 in pretty good shape, clean and well maintained, however the space between seats was simply ridiculousThere would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to workVery badOf course there was no entertainmentDue to the space between seats I would avoid flying with BA in short haul flights.Could British Airways get any worse? Flew Chicago - London Heathrow in Upper Deck / Club World, of ancient B747-400, British Airways business class is the worst in the entireThe seats are the crazy / odd facing each other, with a rude screen, and are terribly uncomfortable / narrowThe food / wine was simply awful, and they didn\'t have the lamb on the menu, but replaced it with some kind of beef mushThe crew were young, uneducated, and unprofessionalThey were waiters and waitresses at best, and didn\'t seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business peopleClub Class on this route was also full of screaming children, one of whom threw up on the flightWHY do BA hold their premium customers in such contempt? I can give you the answer: They have a monopoly from the UK to the USA, and back, and noUnfortunately BA has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but IHowever having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service, which6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwichScreen tiny, scratched and hardly worth looking atis shameful for the national carrier.Boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boardedIN economy class, I can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoffI can book the seat of my choice earlier if I wish to pay, and that was what I wanted to do with my Avios points, but you cannotLHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy eitherI was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.eno special menu (confusing to say the least)Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flightsLeg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (\xc2\xa321 for the frist row and \xc2\xa318 for the rest),which is ridiculous if you had paid \xc2\xa3400 returnThe down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not onThe FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happyWe\'ll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.Bad serviceArrogant staffNot to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshmentsAnd there are frequent delaysI booked my flight ticket couple of moths before my travel and I received an email on the day I\'m going to travel saying that my flight was cancelled andThis destructed all my plansI gave a call to the customer service and they really did not gave me any optionsAfter couple of hours over the call, I am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from MSY to DFW and London and Hyd and the layover isvery short and I am very tense as I don\'t have any options to chooseThis whole journey was very irritating and the customer service is really bad.Delayed 2 hours on outbound flight to Athens due to lateness of aircraft and then due to technical issuesExtremely dated aircraftCancelled inbound flight to London due to technical issues of aircraftNo entertainment during the next day\xe2\x80\x99s new flightIn general British Airways has no customer satisfaction anymoreUnfortunately I fly with them cause I have toIt has become an unreliable average airline.Really poor food, I am little fussy with my food but my partner will eat anything and even he wouldn\'t eat what we were servedThey both smelt revolting and I didn\'t even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldn\'t eat anymoreChicken curry was questionable or again Spinach Lasagne - just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesn\'t mean they what spinach with every meal, there are some veryWe were not offered Tea or Coffee at any point and found the staff inattentiveI would think twice before traveling with BA again10 minutes ahead of schedule, however it took my luggage over 25 minutes to arriveIn Club Europe I miss better seating and more leg room as first priority for Business.The flight was OK but let down by utterly appalling foodThe chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavourThe biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdustWho on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculousI commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetisingCome on guys - even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel? What planet are you on?The food was ok but nothing to get excited about, I did eat all of it thoughMy only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very lateHowever, I wasn\'t impressed by the seats in BA flightsI found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn\'t rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AAI had a really bad experience with British AirwaysThe flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-offThe customer care was unresponsiveI have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple timesI had to go book Emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in priceIt has taken so much time to get a response from themThe bad part is they won\xe2\x80\x99t refund your ticket priceI wont recommend personally to anyone.8 of the 10 flights were changed or cancelledThe flight I was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departureFar too few people to serveSeats on BA are terribleEverything costs extraThere is nothing good about BA anymore.For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business classI was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%Their offer of compensation was \xc2\xa3200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business classThis experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the futurea negative end to what was a bucket list holiday! I feel I have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience!British Airways have reached a new lowFlight boarded on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded, and engineers were working toCabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpfulThe BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offeringAll other food and drink was served in plasticThe entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoeverThe chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedibleReformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossibleBreakfast service made no pretence to premium serviceA very unpleasant experienceI have no wish to repeat, but sadly I have to return to Heathrow in the same way.All those petty things are why we avoid low cost companies, but now that we know those are traits shared with BA, we will also avoid BA in the future.One day before our travel, we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (BKKAfter many attempts to find a solution, it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in ThailandShe informed us that due to the connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled by BA, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors)Unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help)Our intention is to seek for proper explanation from BA in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceledIf we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date, we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelledus but BA\'s neglect in providing proper communication to the passengersI find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire yearThis event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip\'s spending, but left us with one of the worst flying experiencesFlight arrived 40 mins late, nearly double the scheduled flight timeBut they canceled our flight and rebooked us on a flight with a stop to London - the New York to London flight got 3 hours delay, therefore we missedWe waited 6 hours to get the earliest flight from London to Paris, this flight got also cancelled, we rebooked a flight and waited another 2 hoursThis flight got also cancelled after waiting the whole time30 hours we got home and complained to British Airways which was supposed to compensate us for the original flight, Eurostar tickets and the delay of our luggage but theynever answered.Seat had a broken table and nowhere to move to unless downgradedService was inattentive at bestSuitcase did not arrive and after repeated attempts to speak to customer service to express the urgency of receiving suitcase for which I had received automated message stating it wasis beyond ridiculousCompany used to deliver bag, eventually, was horrendousThey asked to meet them at corner as they could not park when parking was clearly availableToo many options in business to put up with this \xe2\x80\x98low cost\xe2\x80\x99 service at premium fares.Outbound flight to Tobago on 1 January was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn\'t turned upFloor around seat not vacuumed properlyWhen asked for meal choice, options didn\'t correspond with what was on menuYing/yang seat layout makes it hard for FAs to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you\'re in an aisle seatDidn\'t bother to watch movie as screen quality poorFlight had caught up a bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicatorDon\'t think BA trains them like that any moreNot on this flightI guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring "Club Kitchen"No curtains in business class: once again British Airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they don\xe2\x80\x99t matterWhy pay more to fly business then? Dreadful! Flew in from Chicago to Heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seenand with awful foodThe controls in my first class seat did not work eitherBritish Airways is fast going down the drainsAvoid!My complaint is about the cabin luggage policyMy full-size cabin bag was given a \'yellow tag\' and I had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was fullThe current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair. Six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelledWhen I called in (after waiting for 45 minutes on hold), I was told it was due to \'Operational Requirements\'A lot of back and forth, but the bottom line, BA could not get me back to YVR until ThursdayI could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-bookI was told when BA cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that theHad some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with Iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid forWe tried to check in on line and were unable towe pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to Costa Rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitablealternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airportproblems with flights or luggageWe were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to Madrid the seats were the same as Economy but with a metal plate over the middle seatfelt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in Club WorldWe were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats that\'s just greedy.My suitcase didn\'t arriveI was unable to file a claim upon arrival because BA 940 was delayed and I had to catch a train to Osnabr\xc3\xbcck but was told I could file onlineThat is incorrect because the online system doesn\'t accept American Airlines strap tag numbersI explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the DUS baggage officeI called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claimHowever, I did not still see my suitcase until four days laterNow I am trying with difficulty in just getting re\xc3\xafmbursed for my modest expenses incurred (toiletries, underwear, doctor\'s consultation, and replacement medication)Awful, pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalantMy seat area was absolutely filthyNot one them got up to assist, not one of them had replaced any of the snacks (the counter was empty, only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs), theykept serving the person next to me, over me instead of going around me, didn\'t matter that they blocked my viewing - that is fine and understandable, but no excuseRudeness at it\'s bestIf you asked anything, the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore, and made one feel like you were being a burden.I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recentlyEntertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabinLie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flightsCabin looked dire and wasn\'t particularly cleanSeats are dreadfulProduct must be about 15 years out of dateFood was of poor qualityNo bus appeared for about 30 minutesCrew blamed the bus providing companyOverall an awful experience I do not intend to repeat.Don\'t understand the concept of BAI understand that they are under pressure, but they are usually more expensive than Lufthansa  and a completely different story, if compared to easyjetEasyjet is not offering any great service, but you wouldn\'t expect itWith BA prices are like full-service, but value for money is much worse than easyjet or Eurowings.My flight was cancelled on November 17thThe flight from Charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to LondonOur 7 hours flight turned into 12 hoursOn top of longer and uncomfortable commuting, I was unable to sit with my childrenThe meal I requested was not available on the new flightAbsolute worst experience! While flying back from London to New York on November 27th, we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn\xe2\x80\x99t have our requested meal available! ItA big name like British Airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff.Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improveAlso check in via BA-app didn\'t work both ways, so again there\'s room for improvementWhere to start! Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn\'t fix that nightit was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small childrenWe duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduledOh dear BA, why couldn\'t you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just tooThe First Class cabins are in need of refurbishment, but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wishThere is no Wi-Fi available on this aircraft type.Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled highfewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmentedAll choices were available but the food is just not club standardPoor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years agoDry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and sconesEarly arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing)However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden serviceFairly dire as alwaysBA is cutting the new Club World product as I speak, before even having rolled it outSo I get on board and am told I now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did I not fly a low cost airline?There no difference whatsoever? The crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperiencedNo oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul I assume, nobody ate itThe curry was so appalling I ate none of itThe chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcookedI cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbourThe driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won\'t leave until it is full! Then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridgeThis is not a full service airlineThe airline is a national embarrassmentThe flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond itI\'m going to try Lufthansa, or Thomas Cook, though I admit I\'m dreading that prospect. This was a terrible flight with grubby cabins, same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or payingThe staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive languageIf BA actually knew their premium passengers they would have avoided this.Service Ryanair wouldn\'t tolerate but with premium pricesEvery two years or so I fly with BA, and every two years I am reminded just why I don\'t normally fly with themWhilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to Milan and left me \xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3 out of pocket as all publictransport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn\'t refund me) we were still delayedBA? Didn\'t show the delay until we should have been boardingGet to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they\'ll put oneIt would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn\'t allowedhand luggage won\'t fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bagSo not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcaseAdditionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengersInflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard WiFi is a big letdown tooWill never fly with BA againOutbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loosOur seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was brokenCabin crew said the aircraft shouldn\'t have been in serviceFlight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before returnNo assistance provided by BATook nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flightWas told club seats weren\'t available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seatsWas told I couldn\'t have a refund of the difference between club and economyCalled back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (\xc2\xa3600each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice forBA is now as bad as Ryanair so will never fly with them againThey\'re charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service. I have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of British AirwaysFor three days, my bag was in London before reaching Tel Aviv, and then the driver didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring my bag to where I was staying.Having flown Premium Economy before, I had certain expectations of what I would be getting, but I was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive Premium EconomyI have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worstThe plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishmentFrom Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat,The headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that I spent the flight having toI find it shocking that BA charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legsafter having tried several times, with no success, I phoned BA and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which I gave up and just cancelled the flight, whichThere was no priority for First class passengersBA gets worse and worse and worseAircraft was very dated, IFE poor, meal service average, no snacks, poor drinks service, crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmalSeats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we\xe2\x80\x99re outdated a decade agoThe meal service has taken a severe cut in recent yearsTo top everything off the crew couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! When you tell BA about a negative experience they\xe2\x80\x99ll waffle onabout how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint - absolute waste of time - don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your money flying BA - I\xe2\x80\x99ve had far more positive experiencesOn the return trip when we arrived at JFK the queues were terribleAfter we got through the queues, the gate staff announced the plane would be delayed by one hour due to a  technical faultReturn flight was enjoyable but the plane was very outdated and IFE screens were tiny.They changed my return flight by more than 4 hoursWhen I asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was thereThen they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classesThe worst business class I have flownNever buy their premium classLounge in London is worse than the free lounge an American Express card providesWhat the heck is wrong with them?Very bad service with delayed luggageFor some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else\'s name and to a different destinationand no further action was takenBut after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still inThis time my suitcase wasn\'t in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airportI\'m tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcaseNo compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcaseLucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserableI think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I wouldAfter this awful experience with their missing luggage department, I hardly doubt I will use British Airways again.Executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days ofNeedless to say that because we are away for Christmas & New Year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was itI repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that BA and baggage handlers have deemed less than priorityBecause we have been given 801 USD No phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which wouldreunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal hasruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselvesAbsolutely horrendous experience! We were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours (in high temperatures with no air conditioning - the passengers were allEconomy on BA is horribleSeats are uncomfortable, no space, can hardly get refreshments (the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water), food is badTo make it worse, when we landed in London we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because BA didn\'t have a spare arrivals gateDue to all the delays, we had to run like mad people to get from Heathrow to Gatwick in time for our onward flight with BAAgainst all odds, we got their with 30 mins to spare (plane hadn\'t boarded yet) but they casually said we were too late and said we\'d have to fly theAbsolute joke, I won\'t be flying with BA again when I have a choice.Unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flightFlight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainmentThe biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interestedNo smiles or even a "welcome on board" whilst walking down the aisleOn arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengersThe service provided by BA has significantly declined over the past few yearsEven the newer planes (B777 and B787) haven\'t got cabins that compete with todays marketAlso, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seatVery very disappointed that I didn\'t choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price.that my flight to Budapest was cancelled due to heavy snowI was there with a few thousends other passengers from BA, nobody gave us any food, any water and the most important any information as to what we should doAfter waiting 2-3 hrs for my suitcase I was struggling with cold at terminal 4This is not what you normally expect from British national carrier airlinesVery poor website, nothing is working and for 3 days no call centre, they try to tranfer you from one number to another without any sense.Flight delayed by four hours - which is understandable due to the weather in the UK at the timeThe inflight entertainment was awfulVery limited selection and very dated equipment/screensPlus they kept stallingThe food was average and I was very hungry throughout the serviceWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you? You used to be the best and now you\xe2\x80\x99re budgetI won\xe2\x80\x99t be flying with British Airways again.I was quite disappointed with my experience with British AirwaysFirst of all, our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in LHRHowever, there was no information on connecting flights in LHROnce on the plane, the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flyingSeats were okay but nothing outstanding - same with the crew.Overall a poor economy class productDifficult to get a glass of waterOverall BA is dramatically failingThose who have BA miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlinesBA is no longer UK\'s national airlineThe magic of Alex Cruz and Willie Walsh is not working if it ever didAvoid if you are paying up front rfor your ticketsLoyalty does not pay.British Airways is no longer a full service airlineThis is over-priced and not that greatSecondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket priceThe seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profitsIn this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet rollI hope that this is not trueCustomer care and service has goneThis flight used to include complimentary tea/bacon sandwich until the much criticized move to M&S inflight offerings and a hot sandwich isn\'t available anymoreBags slow to arrive at Seattle but don\'t put that on BA.Meal quality was averageMajor complaint is BA\'s policy of charging to book a seat - it\'s extremely irritating and stressful, especially in premium economy upwards.The ground service was really poor even thought I used premium counter (Sapphire status of OW) I paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak EnglishStaff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to SpainIt took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really badThe worst staff I had  metI would never choose this airline again.Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have hadI was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arrivingWe actually had to beg for helpThe distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniorsIn our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmareThe flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gateand no one seemed to careOn our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advanceOnce again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gateAgain we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about thisWe said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at allSeats were another problemSo once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom- luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in VancouverSo nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next flighWhat can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistanceIt\'s becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between British Airways and the budget airlinesseats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgracefulMy flight to Berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldn\'t offer an efficient trolley service"Just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge." This option was rammedSome chicken thingy for mains - which was horribleThe seat (the new "First") - is not wearing wellLooking somewhat tiredthe Club World option is horrendousThe 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates"Logic" is not something BA seem to understand - given the high level of negative reviews on this siteVery disappointing.Arrived at Dubai airport, checked in - and endured horrendous securitySeating very mediocreBoring and tastelessThe beef mains was very good - not exceptional and no wow factorMy wife was told the beef was now "unavailable"My wife had an Arab dish which she did not likeMost BA cabin staff are good - this one was a PR disasterAnother sad experience from our national carrierDefinitely not worth some of the extreme prices posted for this route.Agree with other recent reviews: BA quality is severely lacking compared to other Oneworld carrier\xe2\x80\x99s business classStaff seemed rushed and not proactive at all: had to ask for anything we requiredSeat space and comfort seriously under parDid not feel like valued customers.British Airways have been so disappointing and need to improve fastThey cancelled a flight the morning of a flight and so I had to buy a new flightThen my most recent trip was to Miami which I had an expired ESTA but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small feeI am a BA member and must say the customer service is atrocious, as a company it\xe2\x80\x99s just spiralling down.I have never experienced such an unreliable, unprofessional airline, that is so hard to contactMy flight kept being delayed for hoursAfter more than 4 hours delay, there was no point for me to fly to London anymore, as I had missed an important meetingAfter 4 weeks, I notice that they still haven\'t refunded meIt\'s very difficult to contact themOnce I managed to send them a message, I only get a reply a few days later telling me, that they can\'t reply to this case via email and thatAfter being on hold for a while, it turns out, they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hoursA very convenient mistake, to forget a 360\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa0refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiryNo thanks, with that level of unreliability and bad customer service, I will make sure to never fly British Airways againOne issue after another! The flight from Newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in London, we departed lateWe finally got on the Washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from Amsterdam to catch the flightThe delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at Heathrow thus delaying the flight furtherObviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour (around about 23.00) trying to find help at the check-in desk in a practically empty airportus! We were also downgraded to economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business class was fullBA offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down-grade in classThe airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibilityNot a good experience at all and nobody really cares!We were flying business class and expected a fast track boarding, but alas the fast track boarding queue was longer than normal boarding queue! Then on the flight it wasfelt like business class in the plane, on the ground pre boarding it certainly did not! BA needs to improve and fast?later on another text saying that I will have 46 minute delayChecked in at the machines but It couldn\'t allocate my seat numberThe security officer told me that I lost the flight because my flight was at 12:00 and suggested me to go to counter C1Now at the counter C1 a lady told me that the flight was at 12:00 and I lost itWhile I was explaining that the flight will be delayed she made phone calls and tried to explain the whole situationWaited at the gate for another almost hour and in total the delay on arrival to Athens was 1hr 20mins.Very disappointingI was scheduled on a British Airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at Heathrow and having flown BA in the past it was very sad to seehow BA service went down this yearMeal and drinks for purchase, uninspired staff and delay on inbound flightUnfortunately, the London to Doha was operated by British AirwaysThe seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlinesThe IFE was really poor with old screen system and poor range of optionsThe meal was not good related to the price you have to payThe FAs were really dull, nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like FAs from other airlinesBA really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabinBritish Airways is seriously lacking in all areasCabin crew were surly, unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganisedDuring the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleepThe food is very average alsoI would never use them again.Boarding: There are now so many \'priority boarding\' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizensObviously, this was not BA\'s fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmacWhy BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond meEnd of serviceSomeone at the back quipped, \'So you opted for the premium seats, too!\' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassingSeat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at HeathrowAlso my wife\xe2\x80\x99s IFE failed mid flightImpossible to hear information from the flight deckThese ageing 747\xe2\x80\x99s really are in desperate need of replacementThe congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptableThe minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desiredThey must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to supportBritish Airways has turned out to be the worst airline I have flownUnfortunately I am forced to fly them often from PRG, if I want to connect on their One World partner AA, which I have Exec Plat status withBA charges for everything, including waterPRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked forLondon to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floorFood was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sipsOverall horrible experienceThe extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculousBA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only? They charge USD 100 for a checked in luggage even to Emerald partners? Horrible food, aircraft,Included a picture from the bathroom which was broken.Still no WiFi, of coursedeparture and night flight where you can\'t sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortableIn the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all alongThe seat date from the early 2000\'s - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seatBut the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90\'s and is a disgrace to the industryGreat sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture qualityI spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squatThe seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirtyIt was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that greatThe meal service was not good out of BKKBar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkinMain dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap jokeNot enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worstThe only false note was the meal pre-selectionYou have to wait for a very long timeThey did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of timeHaving said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snackNot acceptable on such a long haulThey have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years agoIt is clear to me the CEO is running BA to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery lifeI wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working)BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clientsFurther waitNot only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to myNot impressed.I must say I find this irritating, as I had one piece of luggage, within the rulesI truly felt as if I were in a low cost airline, which is sad to seeShort-haul with BA never again!The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t really acceptableIf it was just business then it would be \xe2\x80\x98fine I guess\xe2\x80\x99 but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limitedEven the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in HebrewThe service on board didn\xe2\x80\x99t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kitsAnnoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watchthan fast track security as we didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow the signs properly)We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improveThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishesDrinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appallingThis biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors loungesinteraction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toiletsUnfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won\xe2\x80\x99t evenstay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales systemSome were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendlyMy first time flying BA and I had very low expectationsThe service (KUL-LHR) was brusqueI had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt NO and that they couldn\'t give it to us later nor would they have anyWhat I didn\'t like though is that the arm rest couldn\'t be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mineThe toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didn\'t work properlyThey always fall back down and there was never seat linersFood was below average.Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affairBoarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggageThis resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the holdSome passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staffThis was quite hard on the staffThe inflight service was very poorI ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at meDisembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggageBritish Airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.We arrived at Bologna Airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed beforeThe member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that ifFor us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the Lake District the following daythe queues in this situationI thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines!We ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at London Heathrow and wewould not arrive in Rome in the AM as planned(We had three checked bags instead of 2 and British Airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional)I can\'t say the same for the rest of our tripWe found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seatslate of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through securityThe BA representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pmUpon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screencould not select seats for our connecting flight to LondonOnce we arrived at Rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag)Upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid forOtherwise I imagine we would\'ve had to shell out $100 againHowever coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledgingSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even afterexplaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcaseI work in retail and I know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the planeI am very angry by this situation and next time I will think twice before choosing the company again.British Airways provided a functional, disinterested service on this ten hour flightIgnored for five hours, not even a glass of water offered and it was made clear that the staff were happy to do the bare minimum and no moreIn the interest of fairness I have informed the customer service team at British Airways of my experience - so far I have been ignored hence writing this review.I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the returnTo start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical faultI couldn\'t pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selectionsQuite disgracefulI was also unable to check in on line, so i was "directed" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not workOf course I had to pay extra $\'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in aThe flight was uneventfulOverall I still feel that BA is just too cheap on it\'s product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium classI was disappointedHowever, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in J classI do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and I certainly do not appreciate itAnd further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seatThe tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for serviceClearly something wrong with the meal ratiosIt also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better optionThe IFE selection was nothing more than averageThe service and product simply left me feeling that BA is way behind other carriers and I concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them againIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of a good thing about this flightThe crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attemptSo three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hoursThe food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heatedIt was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever takenUntil my return flight - entertainment system was not working - ancient plane same miserable foodThis airline used to be good, now it is awful.The plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacingIt\'s more akin to economy, also a real negative point is your at Heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses! A shining exampleThis flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sitPlane was delayed 45 mins & arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record eitherIFE was poor with old films that they call new releases, no where near on a par with Qatar Airways.Negatives - food on on both legs wasn\'t greatSalad poor and main beef meal very averagePudding which is normally the show stopper - not greatWe were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn\'t do enough to helpThe real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over meBA are getting so much stick at the moment - their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excessPriority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confusedI couldn\'t decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety videoTo me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg roomHow can this be branded as Business Class? Is the extra cost justified to fly Club Europe? Absolutely not.I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilledI was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heardOn my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break myShe still didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me instead of apology she said I have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food toAm continually disappointed by British AirwaysIt seems they are now in a race with Ryanair and easyJet to become the worst carrier in and out of the UKTheir lounge at DUS is closed but their check-in staff doesn\'t know that (she sent me up there)Now, not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11-hour flight LHR-LAX, but now they want \xc2\xa32 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15pWhat is the point?The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can\'t watch it, as you can in economyOn both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angleAnother problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawerAnd that adds to the litter problemAnother small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage spacebit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as "comedy", "thrillers" etc but no A-ZShould not have been so optimistic, as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980\'sAircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word goStaff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown whenBA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even when you pay to-dollar for business class the standards are well below even their US counterpartsComplete rip-off sums it up.The electrics at my seat were not workingThis may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etcIt was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband\'s remote control- Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.gBecause my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept \'pinging\' back outThis was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seatThe TV screen was  faultyThe usual \'push and release\' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to \'pull\' the screen, it was very toughEven the cabin crew could not release it properlyMy footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move thisMy husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flightMy husbands charging socket also did not work For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipmentWhilst the outbound flight was great, I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seatThe hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact, the situation got worseAs you can imagine, it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling itIt was impossible to turn the screen off completely.They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to South AfricaThe BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternativeAfter being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% ofThe overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-puttingThey said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flightsupon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of bookingOther airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive, even though both my husband and I are frequent travellers and have Silver cards of their Executive programI will avoid travelling BA even for work after this eventThe worst customer service I have ever experienced! I arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked andthat I could not check inAfter a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up, I was told I can go on a different flight - the problem being that the onlySo I missed a whole day\'s business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one dayWhen I queried the fact that I was unable to board I was told that overselling the flight was normal - "all airlines do it"The fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanationHowever, I was again denied a check in and was put on a stand byApparently, the return flight is overbooked again! I do not understand how it is possible that the product/service that I have purchased, I can not useHow can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that I have duly purchased a good 4 monthsin advance!!!! The disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge, inept company is beyond pale! On top of that, the company\'s decision to no longer servecoffee/tea and food on board is unacceptableThe BA has made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but still keep charging premium pricesI certainly will never travel the BA ever again!Absolutely appalling service from BA! I booked seats with extra leg room with a BA representative to ensure I was getting the seats we neededSo I applied for a refund, after a lot of back and forth with BA they started paying it back, in drips and drabs, not the full amount - soheard was that someone would contact me and would sort this matter out - no one has called back in 2 months nowWhen I call they say \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t chase anymore, You have to await for someone to call you\xe2\x80\x9d BA you are a disgrace, I have been patient and you havedone nothing! Worst airline I have ever had to deal with!I had a horrid experience going to my destination as well as coming back from my destination.No longer feels like travelling with a premium airlineVery functional, but unfortunately at a costCabin crew robotic and lacked personalityOverall falling well below the standards of the competitionGreat pity really.My feedback seems to mirror many other users here - BA standards are just getting worse and worse, and I am talking about business class which I thought they wouldmaintain? The cabin interior was worn and quite grubby, the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business classThe meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economyChatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting BA because of the fall in standards - I\'m not surprised and I for onewould not use them again for long haulTime for senior management changes, as the present CEO clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airlineThe big downside is that Club Europe sets remains stock standard economy seats - with the middle seat blocked offThe pitch is tight - too tight in my viewIf they continue to treat passengers this way I can see the airline very quickly getting into difficultyThe reply I got from the airline below just brushed all the issues I raised under the carpetIf I wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me \xc2\xa360BA want to charge me over \xc2\xa3500 and because I wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a \xc2\xa39.50This airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will I book another flight with BAThere was no priority seat booking unless I paid another \xc2\xa338 extraThere was no priority boardingI did not make any changesIs this some kind of joke? I had to double check that I wasn\'t in economy as there is only one seat difference in a rowThe tough chicken meal was diabolicalThe cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoeverI really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anywayI ended up paying \xc2\xa3300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flightThis is one of the worst flights I have ever hadThe seats were so weak that I felt every movement of the passangers around me, especially the guy in frontReally old entertainment system and my friend next to me was missing the audio outlet! Food was also horrible.By now it is nothing new anymore that the CEOs very aggressive cost cutting, affected all classes including First & Business which called \xe2\x80\x9cClub World\xe2\x80\x9d does not deserve it name,because it is simply appalling! Again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder, because there are smaller teamsFact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommendedOnce a grand airline, today just another 2 star airline like there are so many.have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years! Arrival into T5 at Heathrow, B satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam, and a reason I would choose another airline onWe wanted for 4 satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even get to the main Terminal -  to find Immigration in total,  disorganised chaosI buy and pay for my own tickets,  and do feel that BA is now grossly overpriced forge standards they provideGatwick to Marrakech, the cabin crew was lazy and rude, refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds For the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stoppedAfter 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t finished serving other customers even though none of theWe waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignorednow and that they stopped servingWe tried for over 1 hour to buy some Jaffa cakes which would have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask forI will not use BA again if I can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline .The "Flight Map / Tracker" wasn\'t working on one segment, which was a bit surprisingMy gripe is the awful use of Marks and Spencer foodThis has to be purchased and a good few items were not availableThere were no route maps and no entertainment systemsWe received deplorable customer service recently from British AirwaysThe problems occurred on our return flightsOn the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.MIn the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dockAfter these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flightWe were unable to do soFor obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situationPay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to makeOption 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frighteningOf course we refused to pay that amountWe were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economyApparently British Airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.My gripe is about the current food serviceThe biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food sellingOf course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middlehave no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passedPassengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengersIt is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so longIf BA want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it.The worst that could be said is that there is no magic, that other airlines manage to provideMy only real complaint was the inflight entertainment was rather poor with lots of old films and TV programmes and a mediocre choice of music.British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of waterI told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not trueThe thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first)A month later I checked my online banking and saw they\xe2\x80\x99ve only refunded \xc2\xa330 for the outbound journeynot offer.British Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly withI will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen placesOne can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one\'s health compromised is unacceptableThe toilets were filthyI was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from thereThe attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reasonThe food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options availableI mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desiredThe screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the timeI could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the \'touch screen\'; more like punch screenBritish Airways monopoly of the routes to Spain have a serious impact on the qualityPlanes are the worst of the BA fleet, check-in is a nightmare because they operate each other\xe2\x80\x99s flight, but the online check in does not recognize each other\xe2\x80\x99s booking referencesReally the worst of BA and Iberia worlds together.Lots of late and cancelled flightsPoor customer services even at Silver levelNo assistance for transport.More of the sameCabin crew chatting to each other as I boarded and ignored meThis is inexcusableGatwick South unpleasant tho not BA\xe2\x80\x99s faultEndless staircases, broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the e-gates were out of actionBaggage hadn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevantHad an offer to upgrade to Club for \xc2\xa389 - a joke as there is no lounge at Bari and the onboard value is a max of \xc2\xa330But sinking to their levels will put BA out of business for short haulThere is now little differentiator.Now I know that British Airways have started charging for food and drink on European flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no betterIt might be M&S food, but if you can\'t get any that does not helpthe flight and they have run out of most thingsBelieve me it does not get any better - but the option is Ryanair and that\'s worseNo problems here although it\'s located in a "not so easy place" to findBreakfast food was ghastlyCheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up "eggy" thingHorribleDidn\'t touch it and those that did - left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten bapsthe usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in Club EuropeThe loo basin cannot be described hereA few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product Club Europe isMorale very low thanks to the miserable, mean cost cutting by the BA CEO, Mr Cruz, who has no idea on how to run an airlineDecline is sad and depressing to see as verified by 80% of reviews here be so negativeThe condition of this aircraft was appallingThe First Class cabin was literally falling apart with loose / yellowed bins, and filthy carpetsThe entertainment system was old and slow, and low definitionIt didn\'t matter, because they were filthyThe dinner in First Class was inedibleBritish Airways are now a national embarrassmentFast track security at the airport wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwiseDisappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders arenot exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuringThe inflight entertainment was not working so no tv, video, music or radioUSB socket not workingHeadphones not workingCustomer service very poorCabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs dependFood mediocreThere was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn\'t bother to fetch anyNo refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations, many calls cutting off after 18 minutes +, others cancelled after goingI cannot recommend British Airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serveThe experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer serviceAs the British flag carrier the experience was shameful, my last flight with this airline.Ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like scuffleThey now charge for foodOn my previous three flights with \'the new BA\' we\'ve been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any serviceAs the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets, there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toiletsOn the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take offThe cabin crew seem genuinely fed upThis has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company, giving them no time (or energy, by the look of it) to be niceWas looking forward to eventually flying with British Airways after flying reguarly to Bangkok with other airlines - how disappointed I wasA low budget product with a premium priceI will never again use this airline, its the most costly option (usually) for my regular journey to Thailand, but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines I\'ve usedSeatback screen so small and of poor quality, service is dreadful, seats are old with no powerpoints, no wifi on boardAbsolutely shameful for a national carrier of the UKLower your costs BA as you really are budget - go fly with any of the Gulf airlines or a vast majority of Europe\'s best, BA are nowhere near goodEmployees who do not care for passengersIgnored by cabin attendant on boarding - he pushed past me to talk to ground staffBought a coffee - dreadful apparently artisan coffeeVIP lounge at Malaga used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there) is pretty useless compared with the old BA lounge that used to be there- cost cutting ?? Guess we were spoiled by Gatwick !! Drink okay but limited, food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spaciousUpon arrival at check-in at 6:30 a.m was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with Business class passengers resulting in a 20 minute wait to sortDeliberate extortion by BA in my opinionI ended up buying a new single outbound flight as BA app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flightHowever app again gave up and said I had logged in too many timesUpon arrival at Heathrow I was told BA had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookingsThey said I had to pay approx \xc2\xa3350 to buy a new single ticket home, even after I explained my situationI argued that had I been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did I could have at least bought a cheaper flightEventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for \xc2\xa3122 (charging me again for taxes)Terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when I asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t&c he said he would not likeWorst ever long-haul Business Class flightWe have never liked BA\xe2\x80\x99s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabinThe seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experiencedTo this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first placeUnless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculousIn the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing overYou almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the timeWe should not have to use a call button just to get basic serviceThe return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAPThe service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistentThe entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows itsBA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting themIt is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviouslychoose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor serviceIt will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it rightWe will probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club World) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaintNo refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothingIf it wasn\'t for the rude customer service I would fly againI\'ve flown BA for years, but this year has been disappointingI won\'t fly with them again.Priority baggage didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bagsLate booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from HeathrowCabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flightEverything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awfulStaff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buyI wouldn\'t have minded on a cheap ticket, but this was not a true case of rip-off BA in 2017Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest, the supervisor particularly)Their customer service is also awfulIt\'s a joke of an airline compared to competitors like QatarWhen filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeksCan you believe that? The explanation was their IT system failed in May 2017, an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved.I can\'t comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the Atlantic Ocean, only allows 1 check in free bag for economy classIn addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hourI am truly disappointed with BA these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to LON from GCM you guarantee I WILL abandon BA!Sydney to Paris via London, after flying with them I have to admit it\'s probably the worst airline I have been flyingI received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfastI tried BA, never again.The aircraft was clean and tidy but overall the main BA product has gone downhill and the service standards have slippedDue to adverse weather, our return flight was delayed three daysWhen we did fly, the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating timeThey were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flightThe catering service was absymal, no choice of hot meal; hardly a bar service and no tea/coffee - I suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from LGW, they hadn\'t fullyguess you can\xe2\x80\x99t have everythingBritish Airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost styleThis meant I had to pay for two bags whilst only having oneWhen I asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra \xc2\xa325 or so, the answer was no, which was oddBeverage service was okay, everything was over priced, I bought a ginger ale for \xc2\xa32 and it was a cup, which shocked me as it was advertised as a fullThe only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointingWhat they were talking about was inappropriate, especially how loud they were talking with children nearbyGreat staff, poor food and stupid cabin layoutCrew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengersdied and was on a viewingThe food was embarrassing bad - bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowlsBA, you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support.British Airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myselfThe overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airlineDrinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking withOnboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray tableSeating is crampedThe cabin crew look dejected and have low moraleOnboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyJet, in fact I would argue worseThere is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to M&S sandwichesIt is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offeringsService is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - Iwas even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve peopleThe slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn\'t allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which meansthe ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it downOn the return journey its clear BA doesn\'t care about its European or non-North American routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact itwas dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decentThere was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also goneLong queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though atOslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for spaceThe buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row servedLittle take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchasesThe organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgraceThough a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce I don\'t understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act togetherThe 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on timeService was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take offWe pushed back over 30 lateAfternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plasticThe crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experienceThe desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at timesHowever there was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the Marks and Spencer to buy menu were not available at allI must mention that the cost of the luggage was outrageous and off putting.Slowest baggage drop service I have ever experiencedI spent a whole hour waiting to drop my bag (queue for people who have already checked in)I seriously do not understand how they can be so slowThe company really needs to look after their processesCheck in was slow and not inefficientThere was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a Ryanair type of scramble to board the planeThe 2 bag on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag, a rucksack and then a small holdall! The 5cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the bags before take offOnce airborne the M&S service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was servedBritish Airways used to be my favourite airline, however, over the last 2 years I have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights I have had with themIn this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both myI must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busyWhen I managed to connect I have had to hold for an hour before the line diedHorrible customer service by the way, the person I was talking to couldn\'t care lessboth countries) and promised a refund on the fare which to date (about 4 months later) has still not happenedIf you call them they transfer your call to India where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to helpWhat once was the best airline is now worse than RyanairBA used to be a nice airline with great customer service, those days are long goneShame.After reading reviews I was hoping some were inaccurate, but after this flight in Club World I realise that BA has fallen even lower than many have saidCheck in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for yearsThe lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facilityOnboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoeverThe food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standardsIFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poorthe end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain theseI told them it\'s not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look intoThere were minor issues during check-in at the departure airport in Port of Spain, the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me abaggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn\'t have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process.Simply appallingCabin was filthy, and carpets coming upFood was inedibleThe IFE system was old, slow, and low resolutionNo wireless of course, eitherBritish Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselvesFor them to call it "First Class" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extremeBut of course, this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the Atlantic.I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there isI still don\xe2\x80\x99t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew\xe2\x80\x99s faultI was unaware of the brand changes and was very disappointed after I bookedThis airline is no longer quality with the prices they chargeShort hauls don\'t have any foodInflight entertainment not the best, but still acceptableShort hauls don\'t have any screensOnly thing I don\'t like is the seatsI have no problem with it since I am a petite girl, but still very uncomfortable to sit straight upSo far, top marks to British Airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment serviceBut there the comparison ends because whilst I have always been served quickly (and sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, BA\xe2\x80\x99s service is too slow and seems to runout of stock tooThey also insist on card only transactionsI had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs - and the A321 is a long planeThe return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley,leaving the remaining passengers unservedIn conclusion, clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service.The flight out of Bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft, information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agentDrink and food service poorly synchronised, with no pre-dinner drink, no nuts, and bread served with main courseOverall, a pathetic vegetarian offeringThe Club Europe toilet was grubbyThey are obsessed with carry on bags much like Ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes - not sure what it doesfor them as it only increases their bag handling costsTheir seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tightWhat used to set BA apart was their inflight service - even in coach a sandwich or something - this has degraded to nothing, zero - even a soft drinkSo I asked for water, I was offered an Evian for $5 - no thanks just plain waterOf course he never came back - 2.5 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of waterBA are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier.Departed on time, paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door, don\'0t bother as it has no pocket for documents, glasses etc.Seat so narrow that you cannot move, seat cushion hard and oldFood was blandDeparting Abuja on return trip I had an aisle seat, again narrow and extremely uncomfortableCost cutting squeeze in Economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much moreNow the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toiletBoeing 777 was tatty inside, cabin items (seats, carpets, tables etc) worn, and dirtySticky surfaces, and hate to think what germs are being stored hereMeal standards are very poor compared to Lufthansa and ANA that I flew earlier this year, reflects the BA move to being budget standard airline at premium pricesCabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at BATime to remove the low-cost airline minded CEO there now, and surely Skytrax must now downgrade them to 3 stars at best?A really mixed experienceFlight on time, with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failureIn terms of hard product, I was a bit disappointedThe Premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flightEntertainment screen very slow to respond (happened to me to with another A380 from BA so means it\'s an issue with the hardware)The luggage delivery has been a pain, 75 minutes from the landing to the delivery of the bags is too much, even for such a big airplane.Yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving at our boarding gate and seeing two long lines of a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkennessNot really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young babyThe language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisleEspecially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possibleIt was all truly horrible and very disheartening as we had driven for hours to avoid these conditions in lesser aurlinesPreviously we had had a lot of respect for British Airways standards now thoroughly destroyed.Club Europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight, particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal serviceOverall, a reasonable flight, although Club Europe is poor value by competitors\' business class standards.Very disappointing airline and serviceThe facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits, it\'s a messWhy? Because you get other people stumbling on your feet during mid-flightOr is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleepevery time they need to use the restroom? The TV monitors colors are so offit was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movieThe worst thing was the food - salad was frozenThe beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too saltyMy partner\'s chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spotsThey believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrongBacon was extra saltyOverall, very poor and disappointing experience.The journey started in the Concorde lounge Dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours I was there was not refreshedBreakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedibleIt is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can\'t even get a mealThe airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the priceVery disappointing and they don\'t care.In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottomFor travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at thatThey have failed to understand what their true market is all aboutThe BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any moreThe choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it\'s expensiveFrankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all thoseService could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that\'s in the next part ofthe BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline ora decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middleAs a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me awayDon\'t BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for \'free\' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answerAll we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.Poor check in at Zante airportNot enough desks, slightly clueless staffSlightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boardingBeetroot carpaccio with Goats cheese, melt in mouth Ox Cheek, poor desert againNot left wanting the whole flightThis kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queuesOur outward flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hourWe had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleepHe was drenched and I had no spare clothes for himCabin crew were disinterested -- I was made to feel intrusive when I asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service -- something I\'dbag had "two tablets in and is fragile" so should be stacked on top of mine, and didn\'t bother to ask me about the contents of my bag -- mylaptop speakers haven\'t worked sinceI slept through dinner service, but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfastWhat\'s more to ask for.Staff were usual BA quality however flight experience was awfulThere was no inflight entertainmentLounge in Istanbul probably one of the worst I have been toI am sorry to see that British Airways become a budget airline.Unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously withWell I\'m not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point I wasn\'t eating themThe chicken breast was dry and I got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if therehad been enough of itMushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedibleThe bread roll didn\'t win any prizes eitherI just gave up and refused to eat itEventually some one arrives and notices I\'m not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call buttonDuring that time I am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn\'t going work for meBack at my seat I think I need a G&T with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabinI ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times I\'ve tried to use it and been ignoredBad serviceStrangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menuThe dressing is tasteless but salmon is fineNow this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now I have to chooseJust not recommended at all.Big disappointment, I paid \xc2\xa3180 to fly with British Airways just for one way and the plane was delayed two hours and 41 minutes because of late arrival of anotherNo refreshments were offered, nothingThe customs queue was massive, I got home at 3.00 in the morningI decided to pay extra for BA instead of flying Ryanair and it was a huge mistakeEven the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not workBA is not worth the extra moneyStaff did not speak a word of Italian.Having flown First Class from London to Cape Town and Club back from Johannesburg I have really noticed a significant downgrade in BA service and standards compared to premium flightsThe seats in First had crumbs on them on arrival, in Club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which hadn\'t been cleanedOn the return Club flight in particular, the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on 3 occasions I had toIt was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversationFood in club was averageFirst lounge in T3 not great: sole Elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from 1840-1940 (leaving a scribbled paper sign saying "back in an hour") which wasn\'tIn terms of hard product, the Club seat just doesn\'t compare with rivals any more: it\'s way too narrow and storage space is direThese flights were \'miles burn\', I won\'t be accruing more avios with BA.Having read about BA\'s cut backs on service, I approached my flight with slight trepidationThe downside however, was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarrayIt was tediously slow, with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolleyWith some families split up, paying for items took longer, with some getting impatient and noisyIt is a shame that our national carrier while giving the illusion of a quality airline, is anything butThe boarding in Bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum! Any sense of control by BA went out of the windowThere was no USB ports or entertainment which makes for a long 3 hoursFood Inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold outHowever like many I do feel sad that the service on BA has been downgraded so drasticallyThe buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landingIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say it is so slow, other airlines are much more efficientI thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in ItalianTo be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those I have taken with EasyJet, so now will make my decision purely based on price rather than anyLast time my family split up despite booking row 10 last SeptemberHad this have been a one off then I wouldn\'t mind so much but this is the third time in 6 monthsI have called BA and even emailed social media team, even at the airport I tried to rectify the situation but no one interested or even prepared to tell meThe service and attitude of BA now is shockingSince Alex Cruz came in the airline has gone downhill so fast it\'s hard to believe.The outward flight was delayed for an hour at San Jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervalshave been a miserable flight without a seat to move along toBritish Airways lost one of my bags on our way to Iceland for a week long vacationThis is understandable, bags get delayed all the timeHowever, when I attempted to contact British Airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room, I was disconnected multiple times and given contactNot knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels in Iceland cost upwards of $200 a night, we were forced to sleep in our rentalSince making my claim for reimbursement, British airways has done everything in their power to avoid reimbursementIt is shameful that a company can operate this way and treat people so poorlyI urge you to avoid at all costs!!On my return I felt embarrassed that BA is our national airline, mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal qualityPlease BA, either do away with long haul meals altogether as mooted and declare your budget airline status or serve more appetising, less embarrassing fareYou can\'t stay \'stuck in the middle\' for long!Absolutely appalling airlineWould definetly not recommendCompared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates and Qantas they do not come closeI will never travel with British Airways againFlights delayed from London to Rome by over 1hr, between 2 captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditionsThe food is shocking and over pricedThe planes are out datedThere stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff.The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortableThis is a great shame for a good looking cabinI\'ve seen a noticeable degradation of serviceFlights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn downSadly they seem to have lost their prideA huge shame.A huge disappointmentEven worse when you put it in context of what British Airways used to beWe decided to fly First  because I can\'t stand Club world (backward seats, forward facing seats almost on the aisle),  claustrophic, poor overhead storage on some planesSeats were narrow, poor seat controls (unable to independently control the different seat axes, foot rest had to be set manually), American Airlines and Cathay Pacific new business class products Food was mediocre at bestMeal service slowChanging planes in Heathrow (T5-T3) a nightmar.Three hours to serve dinner which was bland and tastelessCabin Service Director never appeared once despite my TV screen refusing to stay in open positionNever ever again will I pay thousands of pounds for bland insulting service.A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter\'s name mispelt on the ticketAwful experienceThe 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments, and tell row 20 that the service is now closed, and pass the trolley back to the behind1/4 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flightNo smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are sellingNot even a flight map to help pass timeTerrible airlineA national disgrace, worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer serviceYou must downgrade your rating of British Airways if you truly reflect how bad things have becomeFlight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in realityOnce boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terribleAside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads (most unpleasant in a confined space), their service to uslowly passengers was condescending and rudeThey seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us, and that is just not acceptableSadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudenessBA management should be fired, or at least the CEO, Mr Cruz, who is destroying our national airlineI\'m not a grumpy old man, just a customer with over 50 years experience of flying British Airways (and BOAC and BEA), and a direct witness to the demise ofAnother miserable experienceWoken at 7am by text to say 13.30 flight to Heathrow cancelled for operational reasons - phone numbers listed to rearrangeOne not open till 9am GMT, the Greek one no longer in useWebsite also useless: \'We are experiencing technical difficulties - try again later.\' 2 stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights - but downgraded on both sectors[Still not happy that I was involuntarily downgraded on my last BA flight at Easter!] Athens used to have a great BA loungeNow it\'s provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grimPartly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flightCrew apologetic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in BA\'s directionStill waiting for any response from airline re EU compensation / downgrade almost 2 weeks after submitting forms / emailsIt is with regret that I have to admit that I have booked our next longhaul business class flight with another providerIt\'s not this particular flight that\'s at fault, more a general trend downwards.a cheap and sleazy budget airline, thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new managementI have Bronze status with BA Executive Club, have flown a dozen times over the past year (both in Business and in Economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself thatof passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days?)I had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from Rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of other BA flights in May); this (incidentally:ghastly TUI) replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight I booked that I lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport, which the airline refused to refund whenthey simply neglected to raise a cheque for me, according to the customer agentTheir customer service is beyond atrociousI suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for BA failings (all you get is "bear with us, we\'re trying really hard"), lest actually saying sorry should incurI am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to Belfast, and after two calls to their contact center (based in India, with apoor connection and amateur communication overall) still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a Canadian citizen without a UKThe customer agents I spoke to gave me contradictory answers, which, in turn, run contrary to the (almost non-existent) information provided on their websiteOn the flights I have booked which have actually taken place, I have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and ahalf in BDX when the plane lost its takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would they admit this was their fault? Nope, it was all air traffic control\'s fault!),been held on the tarmac in TLS for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane, retrieved a used bottle of rancid babymilk from my Club seat (no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it), sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently usedas confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in Club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrivalOn arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminalThe return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airportsWhich looked totally out of place in uniformThe flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham &Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybethe one who have failed these airlines selection process I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayedOn arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the regionThe handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flightIt is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have to let negative results be posted.What is happening to British Airways? Flew Vancouver to LondonSeveral dishes were crossed off the menu, apparently due to ongoing dispute? Why? Food was inedible, the worst I have ever been served on a business flightThe constant cost cutting by their management is now laid bare for all to see, they need to spend some time on a Singapore Airlines aircraft to see what businessDid not eat breakfastNegatives being toilet and galley noise behind last row 38, elderly cabin, 8 abreast seating on Boeing 747 compared to 7 abreast on the A380Negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in JNB, although hot breakfast was offered which I didn\'t partake inWas extremely disappointed with Business Class on British AirwaysThe flat beds were very narrow (and I\'m only 4\'11" and weigh 100 lbs.) and therefore not very comfortable(I had wanted shrimp salad but was told it was unavailable)Afternoon tea was better but certainly not stellarThe so-called warm scone was stone cold and the sandwiches were still very cold from being refrigeratedI had asked for both a diet Coke and an apple and the steward forgot both requests.I had paid more than GBP 260 for a return ticket and had no free food services whatsoeverTo call this business class is some sort of mean spirited jokeTo start with British Airways lounge is provided by Skyways which as jammed with both people and a bad assortment of foodThe seat width was narrow and the pitch was patheticThe flight from Heathrow to Athens was on a very beat up B767 on Aug 4/ 2017The food on this flight was both minuscule and horridVery disappointing.absolutely no information from British AirwaysCustomer services in India and they cut off conversation oftenAbsolutely no customer considerationHeathrow is a nightmare for baggage.The lounge attendant, however, curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passesHe could not confirm if BA had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade, he had no explanation for why BA did not give us any other option withbusiness seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance, nor did he acknowledge that BA had made any mistake in this ordealTo add insult to injury, the airline was unable to place us next to each other, so the family was split (seven rows apart)They almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff.When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flightI had prebooked my seat as Silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobicThe trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance thatmeans I will not be choosing this airline againI paid almost 1100 pounds to get to Nice and back today, in economy, I was greeted with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly miserable asthey get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite the high prices, have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin andAircraft are tired and wornToilets stinkPlease do yourself a favour and book someone else.My flight got cancelled due to cabin crew strikes, I had no choice but to fly on this day due to work commitmentThe class I had booked was not available on the alternative Qatar Airways flight, and British Airways refused to upgrade me, so they could only downgrade to Economy I would rate British Airways way below the normal standard of customer satisfaction!It is difficult to find anything positive to write about BAFlight delayed, not their fault, but for nearly an hour the staff didn\'t communicate or interact with the cabinWe just seem to be an inconvenience as passengers and no one cares that an extra 1 hour on the ground in a unclean aircraftTerrible and not worth the money.Chaos at check in as another system failureLeg room was shocking for a 4 hour flightNo food, drink, IFE and paying for luggageLong haul BA has barely maintained its standards but short haul British Airways has become a disgrace.Unimpressed! Service very indifferent, impression that it\'s only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flightPerfunctory service at best! Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economyMy understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 starsQuite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peasBreakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offerAnd no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offerbest and should be an embarrassment to Britain\'s flag carrier!How times have changed! Under recent CEOs, most notably the current holder the post, Alex Cruz, BA has declined to the level of a budget airlineBeyond that - atrociousDinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up riceHardly suitable breakfast fareThe entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flightIt\'s very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a CEO who\'s strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest toApart from removing food from their services and replacing it with Marks & Spencer buy-on-board menu, on that particular flight, they even managed to run out of food for thoseThis came only a month after the major "IT failure" that grounded all BA flights for a weekendThe only thing they have left is safety - if they lose that, then it\'s over.It took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 (our row) there was no food left not even a Kit-Kat we had the last can of Coca ColaSeveral factors contributed to this silly situation : BA Trying to become a low cost airline (I did not realise that it had sunk so low when I booked)The blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo andTotally inadequate supply of food on board the aircraft, this meant the sales person had to go through what was left with every sale in the hope of finding somethingProblems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to GatwickObviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BAare paying them money to carry out their duties Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge, the departure board information did not helpThe following day, on the replacement flight, we were taxiing out and a flight-deck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixedThis is my second bad experience with BAThey did not offer me a glass of waterMy first experience was when I flew from Miami to London on June 10th and that flight was delayed for 3 hoursThe ground transportation from one terminal to another is awful also at Heathrow Airport.The London Heathrow to Accra flight is regularly late leaving LHR by 1 -2 hours (as a regular on this route for 18 years I have spent many hours delayedat T3) - hand luggage is a problem on this sectorAll looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while theIt is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a BA premium passengerShe blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staffA shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with - poor food, poor seats in a layout that defies any sense, lousy cheap amenityPossibly the worst pre and post flight experience I can remember4 hrs late on the way out, almost three hours late on the return journeyBAs use of old aircraft is to blameA failed IFE that couldn\'t be repaired took two hours to try and remedyAfter this failed, a replacement plane was requiredBy the time this arrived, BA realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hoursThis led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crewThis was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by BANo refreshments provided, no accurate information, just endless waitingThey didn\'t board the children first and it was a total messThe plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to Tampa due to low fuelwould not have encountered as long a delay as we did A terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called British as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as I can seeI will not be using BA again.The worst business class I have flown in! I flew on the 777 so whilst it\'s not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfortI\'m a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seatIt was very annoyingThe tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay putIt was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusableVery awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn\'t stay putService: if you want good service, don\'t get a window seatYou are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even thereThe layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! NotThere was also no wifi even though BA advertise as suchApparently the Boeing 777 does not have the right equipmentThe layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible tothe cabin crew and so get ignoredI for one will not be flying BA business again.The queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get throughWe left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to getLeg room not great but we are both shortThe flight from Budapest to London was delayed by 22 hours, during which time British Airways offered nothing (no help with hotel reservations, despite limited hotel availability due to theWhen the flight finally took off, we could not even buy food on the planeWe were told that a BA representative would meet us at our Heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers, but he / she wisely didn\'t show up, because I,for one, was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which I won\'t get back rather than some airport food vouchersI have flown several times a month for the last 40 years with many airlines, and have never been treated as badlyBritish Airways cancelled my flight and put me on a EVA Air flight which had a different baggage allowance and I had to pay a \xc2\xa3140 excessI thought that because my Booking was with BA they should pay the excess which they refused to doAfter months of refusing to acknowledge any responsibility I had to issue a court summons on which they admitted they were at faultI have flown over 20 different Airlines and never had a company behave this way when they are obviously in the wrong.Terrible airlineWas affected by the global IT outage during the bank holiday weekendHad to wait in line two hours to get a new ticketThey were terribly slowAfter the whole episode, I wrote an e-mail requesting compensation for the flight delay & my misplaced baggageIt\'s now July 2017 and I still have not gotten back my moniesExtremely poor customer serviceThat was more than a week ago and haven\'t heard from them yetAs for the flight experience, poorThey have become so budget that they do not even provide necessary toiletries like toothbrush for long haul flightsIn-flight entertainment was also poor, very limited selection of movies.Sadly that has hugely changedI found this highly irregular, especially for a mainstream airlineToday I flew from Bergen to London and again experience ended this! This is disgusting! BA charge way higher prices than others and very much more than the cheapie linesand now also charge for food in economy The entire executive team should be firedAnd BA have lost another client!I have been flying British Airways for over 40 years and they are truly awful nowI see no difference now with easyJet or RyanairThe main difference with BA now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff I encounteredNo light refreshments complimentary, crew busy operating Card terminals etc, makes less time to be nice to passengersThe airline continues to pretend to have high standards but it slips further and further into the depths of I will book with BA if no other airlines available.Lunch wasn\'t very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which wasawful and tasteless - she left most of itThe buffet selection wasn\'t particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilliMy wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was blandThe first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets workedIt was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggageBut if I paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes I\'d be disappointed.The rest was disappointingThe outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing, you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure thatThere was no apologyCabin crew weren\'t overly friendly on either journeyIf you have similar thoughts, don\'t do itWe won\'t be flying with BA again, they are not worth itIt is very British - elitist and inefficient.Arriving at Berlin check in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite that it contained fragile itemsBoth times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and uncooperative .I was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seatThe new seat configuration is so narrow now I could not get into the allocated seat as I have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get toI am 71 years old and I refuse to be so patronised so I was ready for a stand up row by this timeNo food left at the back of the plane as usualWhy on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service? If I want a budget flight I will use EasyJet anytime.Mixed review: we had to rebook suddenly for next-day business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgentlyBA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortuneAlso a nasty surprise: no wifi on a 7-hr transatlantic flight.Cabin crew struggled to get through the buy onboard service and I managed to get a single coffee after very, very long waitThrough work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins\xe2\x80\x93 unless of course you are happy to pay moreAny flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in theChaos in economy classOn this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departureWhen will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor managementThe ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helpedThe grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and justVery friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor qualityStill no wi-fi on BA? Even discount carriers like Norwegian have this now, let along the flag carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways.My main issue is the food serviceIt was an evening weekday flight,so everyone tired & hungryTheir new M&S service was a disasterIt took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card - and the machine seemed to keep on having problemsHave to say this services is no better than Easyjet & I will think twice about travelling with BAIf it wasn\'t paid for by work I would not have travelled with themThe service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier.not so lucky! We had a delay in take off but apologies providedI am concerned how BA are going to shoehorn 10 abreast instead of the current 9I cannot conceive how physically eating a meal would be possibleDidn\'t have high expectations but surprised how bland and uninteresting this journey wasStarted in an uninspiring visit to the BA lounge, with a poor food choice and pokyPlane was just about clean but rather poor for business classThe menu was poor and entertainment the worst I have seenAfternoon tea was an afterthought and the forty minute wait for a gate at LHR really summed up the state of BA todayBland uninspiring and lacking the passion to serveNot a patch on Qatar Airways or Emirates and makes you feel quite inadequate as a BritHowever our seats were changed due to aircraft configuration change which is normal to happen, but no any choice or apology was offered (for Silver member!)No complimentary service onboard providedCrew even had problem with the payment machineCramped cabins and uncomfortable seats - now BA is just a budget airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other budget airlines!\xc2\xa0 I\'ve abandoned my Silver status andFood selection mediocre for dinner, the meze starter was average at bestMy main of pasta was bland and tastelessSome of the cabin crew attending to my wife were not as helpful as they could have beenThe British Airways lounge at JFK is truly terribleIt seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowdsNot enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each otherI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed into the First Class lounge despite being a BA Gold List memberThe Club World food on offer in the lounge for the \xe2\x80\x9cdining experience\xe2\x80\x9d was overcooked and of very poor qualityUsual Cub World service on BA which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle, poor food (they did offer food), poor in-flight entertainment, putting the inflight dividerThe crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordinglyThe product and offer from BA is so mediocre (I even saw Club Class passengers taking their own food on for example) the other carriers must be laughing as theyShameful.I am done with British AirwaysIt has the worst service and incredibly rude staffThe flight was delayed by an hour and a halfHowever, what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airportWhen I went to buy some water, the guy at the counter refused outrightThe guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rudeThere was not one person from British Airways this whole time till 1am in the morningAs if this wasn\'t enough, when boarding started and we were showing our tickets, we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to usInstead of politely mentioning that, this member of BA staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the lineWhen I mentioned this, she told me that I was cutting the queue and wasting her timeI am definitely never going to choose BA again.Flight was cancelled then booked then delayedAircraft was diverted to Liverpool whereby the passengers were subsequently abandondonedPoor quality, no aftercare and BA customer service extremely poor in responding to complaints, when they eventually did the shrugged it off as "Not their problem"Disappointing and won\'t be flying BA again.While I\'m a bit concerned that BA is at risk of turning into a low-cost carrier under the current leadership, my experience was that his crew are still doing aI now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate itMy wife and I have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some Avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately notjust anybody pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finishedOnce boarded, we were \xe2\x80\x93 unlike the other Club Europe passengers \xe2\x80\x93 not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirtin between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished)When I opened my meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on itAnd whilst I do not object to being served wine from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has to ask for a refill, somethingnot everybody likes to doThis practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost-cutting exerciseOn previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for Club Europe passengers are available in airports like Corfu, Rhodes, Heraklion, even Seville (contrary to BA\xe2\x80\x99sWhy could the check-in staff not have told us? The waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found someKnow what? We showed our boarding pass, then had to stand (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was openedIn other words, we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers.The \'flat\' business seat on YYZ-LHR was broken and Cabin Service Director couldn\'t fix itExtremely uncomfortable and didn\'t sleep a winkFood inedible on both journeysThey should be ashamed of the Business breakfast on the YYZ-LHR as I\'ve had better in a greasy Joe\'s cafeAlso, the wine printed on the menu not available on both legsA case of over-promising and under-delivering againWhat planet is he on? Now they have a very angry and dissatisfied customerEconomy plus is very disappointing with very poor foodRegardless of class of travel, the seats are less comfortable than most of the competitionThe following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thrillerI started watching a movie on the flight from Montreal to London but the last 15 min of the movie were missingpart of the movie was missingIn addition to this minor problem, all BA flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system: the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible dueto a cracking noise (once again, the same problem applied to all flights).T5 South Lounge at LHR was like a sauna, and access impossible from south security (involves a long walk downstairs then up again)North lounge better on return, but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an updateVery disappointed to see the decline in quality from BA since I last flew with themFor a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a longPossibly the least comfortable airline seat I\'ve ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn\'t stay up, slipping down and banging you in theLegroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into meThe food was also poorNo snacks offered, and the meals were slopI have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comforta genuinely poor experience.To date there has been no communication or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for informationOverall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measuresWe will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each yearEventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important.Half the entertainment did not work properly if at allNow they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches - they even charge for waterand if you don\'t have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they don\'t take cashI have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled toOf my six flights this year, three were seriously delayedMy worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the planeI was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfortI switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the nightHow can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the nightI am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don\'t reclineas they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hoursPredictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours\' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flightI had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcomeAlthough this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meannessI will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA.I contacted BA\'s Customer Services by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who, after saying hello and providing his name, promptly lost memy \xc2\xa3218 ticket! I could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less! I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work isby me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone CustomerServices; and the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really helpBA - you are in serious need of a makeover and self-examination to have customers, such as I, consider using you again and not tell everyone to avoid you andI thought it would be better than a low cost airline, but it is notIn fact it is quite worse, so if you have a cheaper option, do not hesitate to go with themThe flight is full and they say you can only take on board a backpack to put under your seat but not the bag trolleyRude people and ridiculous rules, a company living in the past century.Poor ground service, chaotic boarding via airport busNo greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staffThe shoddy service which has become the BA normForced to fly BA by tour operator, would other wise have chosen a alternative airlineMost food choices for purchase were not availableTea was lukewarm and not pleasantCabin staff rude and unhelpful, a most unpleasant flight.Very tired 767 aircraftBuy on board service took agesSuch a shame, what\'s happened to themInteresting that BA have dropped the "to fly to serve advert" Boarding was the usual unorganised shamblesIn one instance, it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads, coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangersMost of the choices were unavailableCabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders, and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system.The takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their jobTired business class product, old and tired plane (I wish BA would at least try and not show the interior is patched together with masking tape and something that looksThe crew don\'t really have much to offer now in terms of product, although they were professional if not friendlyMust be terrible working for BA now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriersThe inflight entertainment is dire - for regular travellers only the addition of one or two new films, with the rest of the chose the same month after monthreally is no different to flying Easyjet these days.However, on flight BA 2645 from Malta to Gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly guttedmight add) there was no veggie sandwiches, no veggie focaccia, not even mixed nuts (for heavens sake!)Not only that but the Couscous Salad has chicken on it but no veggie alternativeI was very disappointed and BA need to do betterBritish Airways lost my luggage on the 20th June and here I am on the 30th still trying to get some informationWe came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the 21st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we weren\'t providing the correctWhen we asked him what information was incorrect he would not proceed with our calla mess! We were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they would call us, when we arrived at Heathrow we went tothe customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because \'there is no such thing asI never heard from anyoneNow I need to wait for the claim to be reopened and wait another 72hrs to get an updateNot once have we received a call from anyone, our phone bill is over $800AUS due to the amount of calls we had to makeI suggest British Airways take a good hard look at how you treat your customers who spend a hell of a lot of money to fly with your airline andAbsolutely disgraceful.When the meals came round, I was told that BA had not passed on my dietary requirements, and all they could offer me was a small salad (half a tomatoI received no reply, and again there was no food for me on the flightI told them that they shouldn\'t ask for information that they don\'t intent to pass on, but was met with the same \'you should have requested it better\' lineThey are truly incompetent, at one point they started talking about my child - which I don\'t have0/10 for customer service.Nothing, and still waiting for delivery at 1510 three days laterBritish Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported "The most delay-afflicted route85 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer"As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delaysIndeed my flight the delay was, as usual, over an hourThe Club World product is now very tired and worn - no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriersThe BA crew were fine, but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlinesUsual chaotic boarding process for this flight - the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage, but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departureIt will never work on this routingWhen will BA learn? The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, AmericanThe constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor serviceA great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard.I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even taken this flight yet and I am totally disillusionedI have flown with British Airways 3 times out of Manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my longOn this occasion I have decided to drive down to London Heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike! I telephoned BA customer service today toask about the laptop situation, after pressing many buttons I was informed all the lines are busy and cut offI will never book a flight with BA again, even if this means I have a long layover or connection timeThis airline is a national disgrace and the British flag should be removed from the liveryIf British airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismallyWe were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchaseTo add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operationI have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purposeIt was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn\'t help me \'We fly to serve\' I somehow don\'t think so anymoreEasy jet, Ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shamblesI cannot imagine flying with BA again.A 2 hour delay on the screenWhy didn\'t they tell us at check-in? Yes, they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the dayOnce the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meetNo welcomeThe seats were hard and uncomfortableBefore taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty doorThe door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were emptyBased on this I will no longer pick BA as a preferenceRome to Heathrow flight on the 23rd June delayed take off over 6 hours due to technical faultMinimal information and absolutely no customer service or supportBA support and service in Rome was non existentAfter take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably I had to pay \xc2\xa32.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay withBA is now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus, actually thats unfair to budget airlines who provide much better serviceBA has lost the plot.What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timingBut I have nothing good to say about the whole thingThe lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gateOnce aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and ifThe seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that\'s the issueI understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by BoeingI\'ve not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraftI\'m a long term supporter of BA and I\'m so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customertake the money, because it won\'t last, people like me will move on.I realize that nothing can be done about thatOverhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club Europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistanceLeg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economyHad to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa AirportIn all this was not a Business Class quality flight, we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price.The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriersCut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other thanThe amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke reallyToilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myselfShame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels.Food service a jokeI have never written a review on anything in my life, but how can an airline like British Airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food payingservice by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correctnumber of items instead of using barcodes? Unbelievable if the company has become so badly managed, (how many quangos to come up with this decision?) that common sense is lostin corporate nonsenseApart from that, flight great, but sorry BA please admit your mistake and put this right.We were at the gate when BA cancelled our flightWe could not get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggageIt took them 4 days to return itBA will not reimburse us the cost of the flights at \xc2\xa31,200 or the cost of the hotel at \xc2\xa32,000This is a total disgraceHow can they be allowed to do that? Book with another airline to ensure you actually arriveNever experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money is outrageous.Seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped, and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for foodThe seats are comfortable, but both our seats were faultyMine would not stay upright and my wife\'s would not reclineUnfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morningWe were moved to business class - we should have reported it immediately! Sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off, unfortunately the quality has been hit byBar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economyBreakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost savingis really worth the negative impression createdThe check-in process seems to have been automated and I am not impressedI saw an elderly Chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in BA uniform walked away and ignored themNo cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassedThe cabin crew were lovely people and deserve better than to have the name of a once proud national carrier reduced to such a miserly productPremium economy on British Airways is disappointingBoarding was chaotic on both outward and return flightsSeats are old and worn, not very wide, and with little reclineThe IFE is poor in terms of choice, the screens are the smallest I\'ve ever seen, and the sound quality is very badlate the spiral of poor response has picked up paceI didnt think it could get worse but it didKnowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special servicesI got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take it up with Alex Cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty andUnimportant is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest listShe then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know howI had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestepThe moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at BA it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it allNot at this airlin It is incredible that one airline who carry\'s the British flag is such a disgraceI am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speakWhat has happened to BA and we wont fly them again.By far, British Airways is the worst! World Traveler Plus just means Plus $$$$$, everything else is downhillSeats were cramped, recline only a few millimeters, food awful, sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was servedAmenities practically non-existent and wrapped in cellophane, tube of toothpaste (if only the cap would open) could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth, no covers forTotally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word Premium EconomyBefore I forget, the Boarding Service was confusing, calling colors Gold, Silver, Sapphire, etcPeople just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice, screaming for orderTrying too hard to be fancy.I cannot believe that an airline like British Airways have to compete with the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet and stopped complimentary cabin services - no drinks, no snacksThey should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines I am now cofused why I should ever fly British Airways vs Low Cost AirlinesBut waited on arrival for over 30mins - non priority bags came out mixed with priority - British Airways policies and operations are clearly confused and it\'s losing its edgeBritish Airways charges a big premium for Premium EconomyThere were two dinner options, chicken tikka or beef fillet, but as I dozed off I missed outnot worth the risk of a bad reactionI cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they chargeIt\'s not cultural, it\'s just indifferenceThe seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window - you are basically trapped inside and you\'d have to disturb theseem to break off from the latch - it\'s just flimsy! The food is very low quality and tatstes bland - I have already tried the regular meal and specialmeals - don\'t botherThe service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengersOverall, I am very disappointed.\r\n\r\nStill too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to beAn OK Chicken curry was served but I still don\'t see it as Biz class foodThe morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experienceand well remembered! The return flight was less goodDrinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong trayThis cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolateHowever, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officiousHowever, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journeya customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - I\'m off).The aircraft was there, still boarding, my bag was checked-in for my final destination but I wasn\'t! They forgot to check me in for my full journey at departureThey didn\'t let me board, and made me stay overnightI have never seen such level of stupidity, bad management and poor service.The crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from Johannesburg to London were very young, unprofessional, and were missing the special character and wit that used to make theThey were basically (on both flights) rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast serviceOn both flights, there was no water offered during the night, which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premiumThe meals were overcooked, and on both flights the knives could not cut through the "best of British Beef"Given that the hot meals are the same than in Club (according to BA\'s marketing), I would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in Business ClassA perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when I got up after dinner and went to the galley (as nobody cared to answer the bell) and asked forWould you like some white?" I am missing the good old BA and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future, even if it means payingCheck in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delaySecurity was a bit slow (no fast track)Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a localBoarding was a disaster, we were called to board but then waited on the air-bridge for over 20 minutesThe air-bridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no AC or ventilation and some people seemed close topassing outEventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy)There was no communication from the ground staff, which although not BA staff reflects badly on the airlineHot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasantA320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on boardA cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect manyBasically they are not good enoughCut backs and poor service is evidentThe cost of loyalty outweighs the benefitsRefreshments in the lounge Ok, but nothing specialCheese and crackers a bit sad and the cracker were softPlane landed ahead of schedule but priority baggage didn\'t work and our cases was about the last throughAwful, cost cutting beyond beliefDirty aircraft, uncomfortable seats, inflight entertainment is something that would have existed in the 80s, has been the same for several yearshalf empty cabin across the entire flight, ran out of alcohol tooBA have and are continuing to cost cut, but they haven\'t cut their prices to reflect thisI cannot give a 0 out of 10, the 1 is purely for the cabin crew who are embarrassed by what is now Budget Airways.An absolute third world experience once I got on the planeCheck-in and lounge experience were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft areThere were seats with missing backs and \'Do Not Occupy\' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy,A frequent flyer with BA for over 15 years, Silver exec club, I have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past 18 months / Alex Cruzmy partner and I fly regularly in eco/prem and club depending on prices, so have seen the decline across all classesrecent trip to Antigua from LGW was awfulA pretty empty cabin, filthy isn\'t the word, awful in flight entertainment (Rockwell) that hasn\'t changed in 10 years easilyYes they certainly are flying, but most certainly not servingThe cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft, and to anyone who speaks to them theyare disgusted with what the bosses have doneStop trying to make BA budget, we want it back to how it used to be! All I can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the majorIT glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in British Airways.The price of the ticket about \xc2\xa3500 for a 2 hour flight - had no relationship to the ultra-economy service on this flightThe aircraft was very dirty - I wonder whether BA pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines don\'t seem to have filthy aircraftIn Business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for? There is no place to power devices and forget WiFi or overhead screensIn business the food was an awful English breakfastIt feels chronic under investment for years has left this a bare-bones airline milking short-term profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year.Again as too often with British Airways nowadays, flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problemAs a consequence our connecting flight in LHR was missed, had to wait for 5 hours at LHR although there were earlier flightsLong queues at rebooking desk, very little care of customersThen again flight from LHR left late! Breakfast on board long haul miserableAlthough I have been travelling with BA for 25 years with silver and gold status, I will avoid flying with BA again and for sure let know around me thatthis airline is even not a shadow of what it used to be.Awful, newish A320 cramped seatsThe new buy onboard from M&S does not work! It takes the cabin crew the entire flight to work just about the whole economy cabin, with some people not evenBA has gone downhill, and nothing but sad customers and embarrassed cabin crewAnother very disappointing flight experience with BALounge was very busy and choice of food very limitedThe cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditionsFood was not edible, i tried the beef option but could not eat itWhat i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy-Cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at BADeparture lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop ban and checking each passenger\'s bag manuallyOn board was average to say the least, in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on British Airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink(nice products but very overpriced)Also, there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferentThe seats on the A320 were also quite hard and uncomfortableThe whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route (who have WiFi on many flights, food and drink, IFE)I don\'t think I\'ll bother to fly them again unless I have to.Terrible customer serviceI have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days, and they keep blaming the travel agent, even through the ticket was issued by BA,If you get through to their India call center you might as welll hang up the phone, as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming thethird party, will inturpt you when you are trying to speak, just awful serviceAgree British airways is going downhillJust awful customer service which BA, won\'t care to look into.The aircraft came in late, which is a common occurrence with BA these daysWe were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered, although we \'might be\' able to obtain food vouchers once we get toThis was complemented by slow and unfriendly check-in staff, an old aircraft, and a good hour I had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested BA customer service toOn the whole, a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that BA is very much going in the wrong directionThey might be cheap, but can\'t and shouldn\'t compete with low-cost carriers or indeed Asian airlines that have lower overhead costs.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I were very disappointed with our British Airways flights from Sydney to London return, flying Premium economyThe food quality, cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as Air New Zealand and Qantas that we have usedThere are no toilets allocated for the cabin, and are located at the middle of the economy cabin, quite a long walk and at times a very long line ofBA don\'t offer priority check in at airports as do other airlinesWe would not fly with BA premium economy again, it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\'t pay a premium of more than \xc2\xa350 for the WT+ experience for this flight, or other WT+ routesAs a service, it\'s not really premium economy, in fact it\'s inferior to economy offered by 5 star carriers.Good crew, everything else terribleCaught up in the shambles of BA IT system collapse on 27th May so very lucky to get tickets on flight next dayBA staff hung out to dry by appalling senior managementFlight itself next day, crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty IFEWas told luggage would be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of Heathrow from the day before, luggage finally turned up Wednesday - 4 days lateBA have had a number of IT failures past 12 months, simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers ((Emirates on this route) for a coupleShame really, BA used to stand for something and its now gone to the dogs.I am very disappointed by BA\'s gradual declineBA\'s business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worstThis is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengersIn business Class I think that\'s a poor ratioIt took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was servedIt was actually inedibleAfter dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drinkI gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flightBritish Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recentlyThis is a great shameThe cabin is bad, the food is awful, the flight attendants unpleasant and IFE OKThe catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which wasOverall not recommended.British Airways were truly awful on this flight from Heathrow to MiamiVery old tired aircraftThese old aircraft are in desperate need of a refitSeat back screens unbelievably smallWhat shocked me most is just how much BA have cut back on their food serviceThe chicken breast I received was laughableStaff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galleyUnfortunately BA have now become a long haul Ryanair, scrimping on every little thingNot good.We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind themLike many, I can\'t get used to this budget airways approach, it\'s clearly embarrassing the staff who are very goodOn our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictionsThen, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failureBritish Airways seems to be going from bad to worseOn my London Heathrow to Lisbon flight, the card machine didn\'t accept American credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldn\'t pay for his drinkThe length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren\'t offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes toThe flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for BAReturn flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airlineThey are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices.Return Club World was appalling! Seats and surround grubbyEquipment maintenance poorService was appallingStaff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wantedFood thrust at us not served! Everything rushedNo politeness in serviceIf it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of moneyIt is so sad that BA is going to the dogs, a business is nothing without customers and BA are doing a great job at alienating themI will not fly BA long haul again.\r\nAfter getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend IT fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by BA, I approached my flightThe service on BA flights really is terribleI, along with many other passengers, was treated like an inconvenience and I felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren\'t thereI was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staffoff tea ! If BA wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airineThey have in the past left me stranded in Moscow for 5 days when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow, I have encountered rude staff oncheck in, long queues even for Executive membersThey are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status, I will in future fly Brussels Airlines andThey are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use themthey will let get poor reviewsThe cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seatsThe meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared awayAltogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airlineThe advantages of booking club have gone, the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks, the priority labels mean you bags come off last, and you only get priorityAdd to this that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at securityIt should not be allowed to carry our national flag.First, I couldn\'t change it online as the \'manage your flight\' option didn\'t work (they told me it happens some times), and I tried it a lot of times beforecontacting them, so I had to pay +25$ for changing it via phone (they took the money even though it wasn\'t my fault)6 months it never come until 1 day before the flightEvery time I called they said they didn\'t have my cvv which I re-confirmed every timeBesides this, the food was ridiculous, but never mind that, the anxiety, time consumed and the distress they caused can\'t be either bought or excusedHow can a consolidated, serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible, unconcerned for the customer, not complying to the minimum standards? I expected soo much from them, itwas a total disappointment!Be advised, this service is a jokeNever mind the terrible, dated, seats facing one another, but the BA Sleeper Service mandates you eat in their awful Biz Class lounge at ORD, and then suffer no dinnerThis is a monumental conAlso, imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria, and that is what you get in the BA lounge at ORDThe food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dogThe British Airways business class product is the worst by farOld aircraft, old seats, disillusioned crew, and simply the most terrible food imaginableBritish Airways hold their premium class passengers in contemptWhat happened to English class and manners?Leg room on this flight was appalling - worse than RyanairI can understand why no free food on \'short hops\' but this flight was four hoursWith the recent IT debacle they have reached the bottom and don\'t need to do anything else!I am shocked about how the First Class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrierThe presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First Class cateringfrom low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengersThe famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose inthe First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has becomeHow can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on neverending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 MayAlmost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cuttingI should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 & the Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like thisAbsolute CheapskatesBusiness class flight in \'Club Europe\' from Luxembourg to London Heathrow is beyond a joke, and clearly on a shoe-string budgetThe roll was dry, tasteless and completely unsatisfactory, could have easily bought something better at GreggsCrew could clearly be heard bad mouthing their CEO over the airlines recent IT \'problems\'Friendly crew though - can\'t help but feel sorry for them.However, when I went to the airport to check in the luggage BA insisted that I only had one bag allowance and I had to payNow I will have to go through sending the customer service a letter to get a refundNot happy that their system is not in coordinance with each other.Firstly we didn\'t get any priority boarding with our two young childrenThirdly, after paying over \xc2\xa310 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife I needed the loo, first class was out of boundsGutted our British Airways national carrier has become a budget airlineup our future tickets and my recommendations are now also deadDidn\'t get to use the business class lounge in Heathrow as my connection from Manchester was delayed by 40 minutesToilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that I\'ve flown business class with beforeThe only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and I found it difficult to sleep because of thisSeoul to London was what really let BA down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in KoreaIn the days leading up to the flight, BA\'s "massive IT Failure" and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant I was having to frantically check if myflight would be leaving at all, with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completelyThe flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take-off was delayed by 30 minutesHowever, due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days, there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to parkThis meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become freeThis was time I could not afford to loseReally wish I hadn\'t as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the planeWasn\'t at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay (over \xc2\xa33,000 when not on sale) it really wasn\'t worth the hassleBritish Airways has one of the worst customer service you can findFlight attendants were rudeSeat and food are ok, but I find them worse than competitors flying this routeThey don\'t have wifi.Cheapskate airline nowAmerican family with hungry young boys couldn\'t buy anything for them as their machine wouldn\'t take US cardReturn flight cancelled after 4 hours on tarmac with the IT crashThen BA ticket desk unmanned in Geneva airport, so queues just standingjust a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz)Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastriesFood and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to usSeating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I\'ve ever experienced in business - and there was noIFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies availableNo such luck - we couldn\'t be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours ina hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight homeWe flew with 6 of our family to Santorini, the business class seats are a joke I am 6\'3" but I just could not move in the seats they areWe then learnt from the steward that it\'s a new configuration that hasn\'t gone down very well with customersThis once great airline that\'s gone from the best to the worst in 5 years, and on European routes it\'s no more than a budget carrier, money is the keydriver for BA with customers very last on the listWe all felt we had paid for a service we never received.But recently they are beginning to slipCannot fault the staff or flight crewHowever, the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupidThere is now no reason to use BA for short haul when there is a low cost alternativeThis cost cutting may well back fireProbably initiated by the same imbeciles who caused the computer outsourcing problems recently.I was always of the belief that British Airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but I realise now that they are no better than budget airlinesOf course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took! They make it very clear that\'economy\' class is just that but its shame the price doesn\'t match the standard of serviceAll in all a very disappointing experience and I will certainly think twice about choosing BA in future.Booked the ticket on the last minute due to missed train and tight scheduleIt didn\'t feel like a national carrier, felt more like budget airline with no snacks/drinks and fare class that doesn\'t include checked baggageNo service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee.Thursday May 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730This caused missed connecting flight to Los AngelesVery poor communication with passengers by desk attendantsMultiple calls by passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistanceFriday, May 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counterout of Rome is late due to technical issues and I will once again miss the flight out to LAI\'m appalled at the lack of educated, experienced BA assistance! BA abandoned us at Rome airportIn addition there web site is of no helpFlight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact.One crew was rude and when asked could I have a glass of water told me that it would take a long time and he disapeared down the back to The food was slapped up and we were not offered another drinkAll male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the back and ignored when calledIt\'s a shame when you see BA trying to turn around and survive and then you have lazy rude staff giving little to no service to the customers or thehave read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experienceHowever no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabbyThe seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhereNot a nice startThe IFE didn\'t work properlyAmenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor qualityThe toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasantSeat is not up to most Business class standardFood was awful and the \'club kitchen\' almost non-existentIt was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by theThe standard in-flight meals were not bad, but not great eitherThe cabin temperature on the flights to Houston was cold - I had to put on a light jacketThe cabin temperature on the flight from London to Moscow was too warm - I was sweatingThe in-flight entertainment screen on the B777 in economy is of poor quality and needs to be upgradedDisappointed by the non existent service onboard this flightHowever BA have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rates but give low carrier service - certainly on short haul flights.Paid \xc2\xa3116 for extra legroom 51C, as they show the wrong type of plane on \'my booking\' and there is no difference to any other seat you would get forProblem is this route has always used the same type of aircraft so it\'s basically a con.The only criticism is that seat-choice function is too expensive - even for economy classBritish Airways are being very greedy in this respect, and their charges are way higher than other carriersI can\'t really review this flight as British Airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested I reduce a 4 day family holiday to 2Ruined XmasI can review the total lack of customer service, the contempt for customers - all in all, BA are not just the worst airline, but the worst company I haveMy rating has to be the lowest given the total service failures of BA.When we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damagedThe food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tastelesswant you to go to sleep now and I don\'t want to here a sound out any of you until the morning\'! Now I know that the crew are allOverall very disappointing and based on this flight I would not recommend BA.Luggage did not arriveContacted ground agent - they could not be less interestedAs it was a Sunday, all shops at Amsterdam were closed at 5pm so was not able to buy essentials like make upAgent could not tell and rudely told me to waitAll the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage would be deliveredFor business travellers, that offers zero comfortWe had nearly 3 hour delay leaving Orlando on G-VIIU, firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issueOnly slight negative was the dated AVOD as it has small screens and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern systems.The Avios system is now a complete jokeThey are impossible to spendThey release a minuscule number of flights and won\'t allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability - they\'ve just quoted me nearly \xc2\xa32,000 to upgrade aflight this evening so I know there\'s availability - but they won\'t let me use AviosTheir concept of customer service is shocking and smacks of an ex nationalised carrierNoisy aircraft - third time on this plane and not impressedConfiguration in club is not my favourite with reversed seatsBa refuses to credit Qatar Airways avios even when Qatar Airways in writing has confirmed they should be creditedI have given up on avios.So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but thebeef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes thoughStill no wi-fi on BANot commenting the ying-yang layout, which remains a mystery to me (who approved such a nonsense?).Beyond that, they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industryThey have no solution for the slightest problem! We were scheduled to fly to Amsterdam on the 1st of Feb at 07.45, there was a radar problem in AmsterdamEasyjet etc were informing their customers of development, nobody informed anyone at the BA desk until it became a confusion at almost 09.30! We were rescheduled to the 11.40 flightwith another further 2 hours delayUp to now, getting a refund is a nightmare!How far BA has sunk! Flew London Heathrow to Nice and back last week - surly and unfriendly cabin crew, food and drinks for purchaseDoes BA stand for Budget Airline now? I never thought I\'d see the day when I would say BA has sunk to (and below) the levels of Ryanair service, yetI was very disappointed because on my flight from Athens to London (a 4 hour flight) no food or drinks were offered for freeWe even had to pay for water! This was not a low price flight and everyone (except business class) had to buy any food or drinksVery very disappointed, as other European airlines provide free food and drink/snacks, even from countries such as Greece (Aegean Airlines)Will not choose BA again.However on-board the ageing Boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about, the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than I have previously had withThe space available was tight for me; an average sized man - I don\'t know how a larger and or taller person would manageBA has lost two loyal customers, but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remainOn my next long-haul I will regretfully opt for an alternative airline.Having the middle seat blocked and a meal is the only onboard difference to economyWe paid for seat selection which I would not have been wiling to do if I had paid the silly prices charged for these short flightsI booked premium economy to get more legroom as I am 6ft8, however this is non-existentThe crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her 2-year old, and I asked the crew to "help" with theSo no common sense thereDespite having other seats available in the business area, they refused to move me, even though they were seeing the issue (I couldn\'t fit in my seat for a 10They even told us off as they were getting aggravated by us being nosy! I had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats! Needless to saythe food is awful and the service overall is 0/5 starsThis is not the BA that people once knewAwful, awful companyMy \'randomly\' allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights, seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seatsI\'m not too bothered about the lack of drinks / meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles - no cash payment option, notThe staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low BA had sunk, how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape! Save yourAlthough they indicate it\'s against their policies, they apparently waited for a passenger to get on the flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow, causing a 20 min delayAs a result, we missed our connecting flightHowever, they did not announce any arrangement for out flight, even though we specifically asked the flight attendant to checkThis is the second time in two years I had poor experience with British AirwaysTheir service is consistently unacceptable.The interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambienceAlso, the IFE seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolutionA weekend evening flight that was quite emptyAfter flying BA for several decades, I have decided to cut my losses on air miles and tier points for long haul because of the cost-cuttingTired old plane with vintage entertainment systemAfter a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring serviceIncorrect drinks were then broughtI\'ve written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from British AirwaysI\'ve flown BA a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it\'s disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be goingNow the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight (boarding 6.15 for 6.50 flight) is onto a bus to a plane that is never readyand always departs lateAdd insult to injury and no food at all on the plane! So game over for me and any trace of a relationshipIt\'s now tedious & you have to put in all the effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection!Food and drink choices/quality were decent, but not on a par with some other carriersIt\'s clear BA\'s cost cutting affects all cabinsOn the return leg, it\'s worth noting that access to/from the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consumingBA12 onboard British Airways A380 for the gruelling 13 hours from Singapore to London Heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengersThis route is now also served by Garuda and Singapore and I can say BA are at the bottom of the list for the economy serviceSeats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest, the pillows are wafer thin - like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundledFood is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers, chocolates and other things that you can snack onThis also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section hasFurther toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasn\'t refilledBA have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant - polite and respectful but minimum effortOr alternatively try the competition which will soon include Norwegian Air and I can\'t see how Norwegians\' economy class can be any worse than BA\'s.Won\'t bother againSo over them.I then had to cancel the booking and instead I booked a flight with BA to the Maldives.To my dismay I was not refunded what I expected for the fareInstead they only refunded the taxes/insurance etcfor the cancelled bookingThis they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they would not pay me backEither the executive club of BA are lying or they are incompetentI was asked the time and date when I called BA but unfortunately I do not have it because I did not think it necessary to log the callIt is obvious to me that BA do not honour their commitments and I will no longer fly with themI have been an executive member for 40 years and this is how BA treat their customersAn absolute disgrace.They abandon you on a return flightRude and aggressive customer service departmentBoth BA flights in the morning/midday and the only flights to Heathrow were delayed by up to 3 hoursNo clear sign on boarding gate screen of delayed flights and big mess up of mixing the delayed flights on the screenResulting in being stranded in Rome airport with BA customer service not willing to take any responsibility for their mess up and no compensation or even refund, let alone minimumIt was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers, and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay theboarding process? BA on short haul is simply a budget airline, and worse than their competitors in the hand baggage managementI wasn\'t impressed by their on board service eitherThey were so greedy to earn money from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers, even though they were complaint by other passengers.What a disappointment, the aircraft was an old 747-400 badly in need of a refitCabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to workStaff were nice but no noticeable difference to economyTo be honest BA had a cheek to charge for this supposed \'premium product\' This was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on VirginTo make matters worse the BA customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effortWith no regards for keeping future businessTo be honest a poor service all round from our national carrierWith BA and being a Gold (Emerald) member I have lost my patienceWhilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error, it has been 7 days of thisI have contacted BA through their twitter account to be told to call their Bahrain call centre, which of course does not work but have been told to call the4 times I have called at my own expense to get people with poor English, have no idea how to manage the upgrade, quote outrageous prices 4 times the webBA could not even be the acronym for budget airlineAbsolutely useless.Wow, who is running this company? In over 30 years of flying I\'ve never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as British Airways has recentlyI can accept that I now have to pay extra if I want to check in a bag, but to sit on a \'full-service\' airline for over 2 hours withoutso much as a complimentary cup of water, really? Did I miss something, have they lowered their prices? No, they just want suckers like me to pay more for somethingBA now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we\'d almost reached our destination there was a bit of anargument with a passenger who\'d ordered a hot sandwich, but because the payment machine wasn\'t working, they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger withoutThe atmosphere was pretty grim, it\'s been a few years since I\'ve experienced such a miserable economy flightBritish Airways was a great carrier, even a year or so back, but now it\'s really overpriced rubbish, and they don\'t make me feel welcome anymoreService was OK but things are not as they were with British AirwaysFood bland and unexciting, drinks service limitedBreakfast was served way to late in the flightInflight entertainment worked OK but the volume/ bud type headphones were poor and distorted the dialogue which was hard to followService was an absolute shambles! 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business classAirways have really let themselves go downhill - will not be going out of my way to fly with them again unless they\'re the cheapest option.The new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly421 Euros for the worst business class flight you can imagineBusiness class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked offI was hungry and all they had was some ham dish and nothing elseSo I practically had nothing to eatI got the kosher meal but it was vileSome sort of salmon that was tastelessVery poor experienceBA should not call this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier.There were no complementary snacks offered, we had to pay \xc2\xa360 each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the holdBritish airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the "fees" they have to pay at HeathrowI don\'t buy it thoughRecently as the Director I have been getting complaints about service, cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff, which I have listened to but have been too busyand really hadn\'t listened properly, exactly what BA seems to do based on my personal experienceService levels in the cabin are minimum, food is unexceptional, and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price, and towards the end of the flight you areoffered a second drink and \'a biscuit\' delivered with all the fanfare of a \'gold bar\' being delivered, however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in PremiumEconomy was both palpable and vocal, and staff could not have cared lessBA management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completelyThe marketing image does not match the realityBA Ground service and management at Toronto is appalling, staff sitting around, passengers bags missing, delayed, no one to help? staff being openly rude and dismissiveMost of the JFK flights are 20+ years old Boeing 747-400s - prone to breaking down on the tarmacThe 747 "New 1st" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possibleHorrible soupWe were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedulePlane seemed pretty empty and Club was very emptyClub is a lousy set up and the seat is appallingAs we walked through the cabin I was reminded how cramped and daft the ying yang seats are.The first one was rammed - end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the placeThe lounge is long, long overdue for a refurbishmentThe cabin looked a little tired and I suspect the plane was one of the first to have New FirstNo amuse bouche - and no flowers in the WCsMy excitement was short livedThe soup was horribleThe salad never arrivedWalked the tarmac to the plane as BA are too mean to pay for a skybridge anymoreWhat an embarrassment! Our national carrier has become a laughing stockTwo elderly male flight attendants were barely able to service a full flight within the time availableBritish Airways used to epitomise service and quality : it is now just like any other cheap carrier.Its not as "user friendly" as the North - and meanders around, up and down - all over the placeUsual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seatsPlane old and dirtyThe WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the "bowl" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous personMy wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tastelessYou don\'t expect much nowadays from BA and therefore you are disappointed - before you get a chance to be disappointedCrew were fine - and don\'t like the BA cost cutsAs one said "we spend half the flight apologising to passengers." They also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloonDisgraceful.I was surprised at the service or lack of serviceOur national carrier has turned into the worstThe food was absolutely appallingI had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless.The chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea pur\xc3\xa9e,I tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.Then tea/coffee was served I am not expecting a gourmet meal, but there was no thought given to the food provided on British AirwaysThere was no fruit, no salad, or proper vegetablesThere were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic waterThe flight entertainment did not existI have asked her not to book me on British Airways againThis by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly I just couldn\'t wait to get off.BA airport staff faultlessSad that happy passengers only a few post a positive reviewCheck in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flightNo priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn\'t even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class wasout of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn\'t it fixed prior to the flight?)For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop themConstant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet! Not good enoughDisembarking was slowSingapore to London Heathrow - after reading the negative reviews and the press about BA of late, I was not expecting much at all from this tripBA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgementOnce we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn\'t expect any either, they just looked on andI still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, asI prepared myself for the worstNot any moreIt\'s not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakesAnd I\'m now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6It\'s hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don\'t seem to care anymoreThe last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedibleI have to say I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leaveBoarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for allThe inflight entertainment system didn\'t work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearlyI have noticed that BA don\'t seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers tobe complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengersThe captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn\'t the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfactionHe explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - Iwas not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungrythe two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toiletsI have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concernie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry withI do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestionI only experience this after flying on 777\'s and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problemsThe captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceableCustomer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacksThey would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn\'t expect them toBy way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth athird of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA\'s level of compensation,I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this routeI am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive oneIt hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and British airways except the ticket priceMy disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken toI haven\'t flown British Airways for years and I shocked by how much it had gone downhillPretty poorFlight from London was very cramped, I\'m slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortableSeat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system forThe seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hoursThe food was ok, nothing specialNot very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enoughAs a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrongYou expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can\'t even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficialI am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit, like most peopleI cannot believe what is happening to BAThe attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality productCramped seats, chaotic boarding, every flight announced "our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags"In other words, they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggageTwo trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the wholeHow can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airlineIt is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service - a shame to be called BritishThis airline is in terminal decline and I need to look for matched status from a proper premium airlineDon\'t pay for BA shortfall, use cheap alternatives, its the same service.The only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be re-bootedI did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked bagBoarding was sort of a mess, as BA let frequent flyers (not flying Business) board through the Business class door, so there was a flood of people moving back andforth to get to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process, so you did not feel like being taken care of during boardingAircraft was a 3-class Boeing 777-300 and looked a bit "tired"Seat was the absolute worst part of this flight, as it is narrow, too hard to have a nice sleep, and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having ahigh, no giant here) and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible, thereforeyou have literally no space to store anything, not even your glasses if you wear themnice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not workingBA needs to improve Business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all European carriers, not even to compare the Middle East airlines.Middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less roomBA are getting this wrongWhy are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standardsI hardly call \'cheese on toast\' a satisfactory meal choiceIt is not what the customer wantsBA are turning into a high cost no frills airlineTo start with, awful seatsI felt like I was being squashed by both passengers on either side of meThen it was rude staff, I was shockedTo top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and was working his way backWhen I interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with meWhen I moved my seat back after they had removed the food trays, a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at meI\'m a female travelling alone and I felt frightened by thatJust shows how little space everyone has been givenI\'m really disappointed with BA.Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to whatHow visible this was! Few people bothered to purchase the over-priced snacks and drinks on offerAt the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without windowDirectly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy - not least because of the constant queues alongside themEverything about British Airways now is shabby, telling passengers how little they are valuedAnd this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservationsSo, no, I won\'t be flying them again unless all other options fail.This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the \'stewardship\' of Se\xc3\xb1or CruzIt started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just likeI asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked onThis is high in potassium, a fish I must avoidI asked what else was on board, only to be told that I would have to pay \xc2\xa33 for an M & S sandwich from economyIt was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should be treated this wayThe (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassedBA should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriersNo idea whyI am not a frequent flyer(Gatwick\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday morning check in scrum is awful)Slightly poorer quality of meat on return but that will be the Peru catering supplierCabin clean, but plastic partitions and carpets are looking a bit tiredHate the BA penny pinching that even when you have paid \xc2\xa31600 they still want another \xc2\xa360 to pick a seat.I would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with BA but can find nothingThe layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up,the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get upI do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutelyand was still coldI know that many former BA customers have been bemoaning the fall in standards aboard and I regret that I join that group that will, if possible never fly BABritish Airways seems to be having an identify crisisAre they a full service or a low cost carrier? The meals have been cut back to almost nothingSeat selection fees aboundSeat fees: I don\'t know of any other "full service" carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticketvictim of BA\'s indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers)On the return a Boeing 747-400, the system was an older on-demand system, with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchableBut BA just feels cheap and stingyThe food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedibleAlso, they have eliminated the second meal/snack service - all they served was tea/coffee and a cookieVery poor indeedIf not for the disgusting food i would give a 9/10.The seat had barely any legroom and it reclines only 1 or 2 degrees - impossible to relaxFood and drinks (including coffee and water) are now being charged and the airline only provides one trolley for whole planeWe were sitting in row 28 (of 30) and it took us nearly 2 hours to be served and only cards are accepted, which makes things worseAppallingThis is a salute to the fantastic staff at Terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost, because of American Airlines terrible customer serviceThe trip took place on April 3rd 2017 We risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at LHR, because of AA somehow "magically" losing our itineraries and notThe plane was old, seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpetThe food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and theremy knees were stuck into the seat in frontSeats were not reclining eitherThe food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were onlyDo not fly BA to RussiaThis could be great or horribleBooked and paid for an aisle seat, but no legroom and narrow seatDid not eat on the aircraftThe food bore little resemblance to the photograph - dry and not filledI feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food, receive payment (you can\'t use cash) and then clear it all upBritish Airways European flights are nothing more than a no-frills airlineThis is not good enough.British Airways have lost the plotCheck-in is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed, such as gold members, bronze members, families, business class, silver membersThere is no food, nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail\'s pace with a trolleyI can\'t believe BA now make passengers pay extra for food and drinkI wonder what has happened to BA for it to have fallen so far? This will be my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available asBA is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore.I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispiritedThe seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlinesThis is really quite irritating especially during meal serviceNo attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaintsI find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as wellI think BA don\'t care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken offBritish Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flightThey really don\'t appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.Economy overseas is a joke too, they bring the premium drinks/service from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they couldBA have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appallingThere\'s just nothing positive left to say about themFrom the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats, to the disgusting cheap mealsThe flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they\'re embarrassed and have nothing to offerAll this would be fine but British Airways still charges premium prices and for what? I just took a flight on the same route with Virgin Atlantic and what aI\'m afraid to say I won\'t be flying BA anymore unless it\'s to use up avios I\'d acquired!So I had to wait another 3 hoursI explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time forThey were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the planeIf that wasn\'t annoying enough, I could not believe I asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of waterThey also charged the woman next to me for a cup of teaTo end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the processBritish Airways has gone down, no more food on board? Arrived in Nice and it was 1 hour before we foudd our Baby\'s buggy in another section altogether, no oneWhen returning no buggy arrived at Heathrow - my two year old is now without a buggy and no one knows anythingI was told three different messages we have the buggy, we don\'t have the buggy? Terrible service all round, the airline has gone down and staff really don\'t care -They simply don\'t cater for families or care.My ordeal started when I could not check in onlineFair enough but I should have known something was wrongWhen I get to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted to get a good seat) I was told that Premium Economy was overbooked, and that I was involuntarily beingThe staff were not even nice about itWhere they got this amount, I don\'t knowThen they tell me I need to contact BA for a refund of the difference in priceWhy should I need to contact them? They moved me, they know they moved me, shouldn\'t it be automatic? So I am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistakeI had a horrible flightI have severe back pain (one reason I booked premium, for the extra room) which was made worse by my economy seatMy screen did not work for movies, although the flight attendants did tryIt is as though they wanted to make me have a bad tripFast forward, while in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declinedAlso declinedReally BA? I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not workingNot anymore I have had it with BAI will not fly with them again because when there is a problem, they do not come through.\r\nMy only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business classAs the fight was not full, I probably could have gotten seats together at checkin, but I did not want to take the risk, and BA got additional revenue, whichwindow seat (both of which were not available at check-in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand)Now it is just another expensive airline with low cost serviceThe ticket prices are still very high but they don\'t offer any food or drinks any more for short haul flightsReally dissapointed.We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British AirwaysThe service on this flight was appallingChosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the serviceThe galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of waterCabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flightBA have totally lost the plotThey are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Coto realise their failingsBusiness seating configuration is ridiculousAgain service is in reverse but the costs aren\'tI don\'t think they have a clue what they are doingThe lounge at San Jose is a joke.The flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow was extremely uncomfortable, although the entertainment was quite good on the TVs, the food was horrible, plasticy tasting, and above allnot tastyThe flight from Heathrow back to JFK had many delays, although this was out of anyone\'s control, it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to boardAt first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible, but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointmentsThe other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new planeI wish the discomfort of the plane, bad food, and time of delays were reduced dramaticallySo far, not a good first trip on British Airways.\r\nVery very poor customer service from British AirwaysWhile upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boardingOn arriving in Oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was fullWe were left there for 4 hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshmentsWe were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that dayTo say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement.\r\n\r\nI had to change my flight back from San Diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospitalI do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable, but BA were absolutely no help at allThey flatly refused to change the flight so I had to buy a ticket in the only available class - World Traveller PlusAbsolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because I was walking with a stickI\'d requested an aisle seat, had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers asReally poor value at $3,300 and rubbish seats, uncomfortable and tv screens that aren\'t greatThe food was awful - clear that costs are being cut massivelyMaybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful! It\'s a pity reallyBut they keep trying to say that BA is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they\'ve decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high pricesHowever, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we gotI wasn\'t too fussed about that, until I got on my connecting flight to Edinburgh where I found out that they no longer served free food! By this point, Iwas pretty hungry so I caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll, which never happened because the trolly never reached me! To top it all off,we left Heathrow late because of a computer problem, meaning I missed my train connection in Edinburgh - but I understand that these things happen at timesHowever, recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make BA a lot less attractiveFurthermore, the headphone jack on my IFE was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight, which was disappointingBut don\'t go out your way to fly them - if there are cheaper or direct options, just go for them instead because there isn\'t anything particularly outstanding.To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrappedThe seats remain tiredThe vanity screen was not working properlyThe entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratchesThe carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeedThe toilets are \'old\'Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selvesSad but trueToo many apologies for the rubbish decisions of managementOn this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.gThey have also stopped the ice-creamFood served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheeseBlankets are faded and raggedThe toilet bags are a jokeCheap and nastyFlight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why, and we were not kept informedDuring the flight I felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class, and my calls torequest additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindsetThe main meal we were served was absolutely awfulIt was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just like gunge, and was not edibleI really don\'t know how they could have deemed this meal acceptableAlso the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed - which seemed totally unnecessaryAs I was hungry between courses I went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor, and the staff seemed to react badly to this for someI have been a BA silver member for many years but now see no reason to renewThere is nothing redeeming about BA.What was I thinking flying this airline? For the second time travelling this airline our luggage has been lostTwo years ago London to Dublin our bags were lost for two daysSo this flight our bags are left in London again! Now I\'m stuck in Dubai in winter clothes, missing the pools and beaches at our resort waiting for our bagsHowever, business class on BA Europe flight is no different to economy so don\'t pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat.Just got off the flight from Heathrow to New Orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights I have ever had toThe legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight - first time I have ever been unable to open my laptop to work (I now understand why theydon\'t offer wifi on board!)The seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say, then it is a dreadful experienceIn my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughoutI have travelled a lot over the years, first, business and economy, and had a gold British Airways card, but this was just terrible and I don\'t really know whatWhat we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usualT5 feels like a monopoly - Galleries Lounge food is simply appallingBetween breakfast and lunch there is no hot foodThe upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious cleanBA flights are often late now in my experienceThe Club World A380 seats aren\'t comfortableDespite everyone knowing, crossing over someone\'s legs too get out is still a nuisance Many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued, let down after years of loyalty and serious spendingWe\'re not getting what we\'re paying for, although chargedThat\'s the sad bit.I am just sad to have to write this reviewof the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry forUnfortunatelyThe result is a pityNo more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747\'s to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777\'sBritish Airways as a premium airline is lostEven with my status renewed, I don\'t think I will fly them again if I don\'t have toNo, no, no, British AirwaysYou\'ve messed upSomeone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said "Let\'s\xe2\x80\x94 loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-pacedA piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customersYou\'re promising things you can\'t deliver, BAYou now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that\'s indirect, but only idiots can\'t see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to beBA used to call \'medium haul\') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the planeOh, and by the way: why don\'t the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to returnto the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: "British Airways, the world\'s least favourite airline".In hindsight, I wish I\'d booked a different airline and not booked BA based on its legacy reputationTo say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatementRegardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortableEven on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5"8, my knees were grazing the seat in frontLucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worseI am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don\'t expect anything for freeSadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty\'They never give us enough foodNeedless to say that BA can no longer live on their past reputationSadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the listI\'d say I\'d give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, I won\'t botherWhat a shame.\r\n\r\nSadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a choreThe loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step downEven worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an \'improvement\' to offer paid-for M&S food on boardOh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an \'improvement\' in service is beyond meNot even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine- wouldn\'t recommend you do the same)The \'card-only\' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the otherNext on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advanceNot wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the wholeCheck-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn\'t work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn\'t let meSo I couldn\'t use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting timeFlying short haul, there is nothing to differentiate BA from easyJet or other no frills airlinesAdd to this the lack of choice on their "menu"Well done BA, you\'ve alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new onesThe flight from Heathrow to Belfast is my main gripeThe flight was meant to depart at 1645, but was delayed to 1720, hardly a big deal right? Wrong! The gate only went up at 1650, this led me toIt was 1730 before everyone was boarded, again, hardly a big deal except that we didn\'t take off until 1830, which meant that my dogs had to spend an extraThe flight itself was full, which wouldn\'t have been too bad if there hadn\'t been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stankI won\'t go into details, but she smelled rancidI was a few rows back and so didn\'t get the worst of it, but I could see others who were closer who were not having a good time atNeedless to say I didn\'t enjoy the flight at allI would go so far as to say that it\'s probably the worst flight I\'ve been on, and I\'ve flown Monarch and easyJetI did e-mail BA with my concerns, but they didn\'t bother to replySo, again, well done BA, you\'re squandering customers good will toward you like you\'re burning fifty pound notes.British Airways have lost their way, front line staff are still excellent, but behind the scenes customer service is now at an all time lowThe quality of aircraft and seating is below other airlines, they need to sharpen up their act before even more passengers desert then.\r\n\r\nBritish Airways has got it wrong on short European haulsMalaga to Gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class, the food / drink trolley will block access to the toiletSeated at the tail end of the plane, the food is very likely to run outCredit/debit cards only, no cash, and this meant a very painfully slow "service"class", leaving me wait for over an hourI was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about 80 minute, a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle, then ofThe cabin crew seems desperate to get the 1 trolley (hence the slowness) to the end of the cabinPeople needing the toilet was obviously not a priorityThey certainly did not let me pass during the 40 minutes or more without air turbulenceIt has been a long time since I have been on a British Airways flight and time has not been kindThe boarding process was chaoticExtra security checks at the gate itself, hardly surprisingThe biggest problem is the staff moraleEvidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for, any wine was by the glass, very cheap cutlery etcCompared to the ME or Asian or my usual ride, Qantas, BA have slipped significantlyWhat I struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights, BA then expect you to pay an additional \xc2\xa377 per person each way to reserveI would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not, as there was one couple on the return flight who had notBritish Airways never fails in terms of being on time, but I will end my business with them after more then 30 flights and having said very good things aboutThey seem to be cutting corners with everything, passengers are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub, justgoes to a remote stand and takes forever to get to the terminalNot worth the money spent.On our 13 hour night flight I discovered that my seat was broken and could not reclineComplained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when I returned home to AmsterdamBA replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a GBP25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gaveWhat an insult! Its unfair that I paid the same price as the rest of the passengers, that\'s unfairThey do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matterVery arrogant and not customer friendly at allI feel cheatedBritish Airways obviously does not value their customersA GBP25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day, but for a long overnight flight, its an insultSent 2 e-mails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore.Boarding and departure went normal, but than, close to take-off, the ordeal beganCaptain announced a technical problem (at approx09:15 pm) and that\'s when the horror startedOverall, we ended up sitting in the plane until 01:00 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane (any attempts to fix the fault failed)Check-in took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers, and the place was like a freezerOld, tatty 747, very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phoneWorst of all, the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in London, and cancel my connection to MunichFollowed up with a call (had to wait approxWas paid a mere $50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for (the expenses were $900)Decided to do some research and it appears that under EU law, airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours (my delay Absolutely atrocious customer service, lousy productHow on earth BA deserves 4 stars in beyond me.Worst flight ever with British Airways, you can see why they have fallen out of the top 10! Very lazy and oblivious staff membersThey ran out of food during both meal timesWe were promised a replacement but nothing came until they cleared away the traysAll we got was "oh sorry" and a re-re heated mealEven after complaining to customer service after the flight we weren\'t treated much betterIf it wasn\'t because for the avios program it was enough to put me off for a life time!I have never had such a bad experience with British Airways beforeThe cabin staff were rude, lazy and obviously did not want to provide a servicefloor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanksFood was good, the staff were absolutely appallingWe pay good money for Business class and this chaotic and rude service is not what I expect from my National Airline.The new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat, but I was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offeringI was very wrongThis is appalling, British Airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offeringI went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft, they completely understood customer frustrations, they just have nothing to giveThe crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once hadThe business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitorShort flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at mostSeat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut toLounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway caf\xc3\xa9, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaningThe toilet was disgustingOnboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffyAs an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using themIt is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputationIf you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated.The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn\'t much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great hunks of chicken and vegetables, just notThe management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting "it\'s what our passengers asked for"to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and Europeanflights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flightsUnfortunately British Airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease it\'s shareholders.Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz loungeT5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirtyRidiculous leg room -at 30 inches maxVery crampedDon\'t like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removedReturning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines)A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves toSlow food and drink service with little take upSome couldn\'t buy as no cash acceptedNot even juice, water and coffee offered for freeThis penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high classThe whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finishPoor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greensNot Biz class food and pretty averageOn the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down gradedThe biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacyHow the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haulThe short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you\'re getting and it\'s reflected in the fare and extrasWith less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the priceThis suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airlineThe only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and AviosIt\'s only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I\'m off! Hello Star Alliance!flight which would not work for megoing to force me to pay \xc2\xa350 for a bag to check my deviceTo add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason tofly BA any longerI was very excited to fly on the new Dreamliner from London Heathrow to Dubai, but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboardFirst the IFE felt very old and not clear at all, something you\'d expect on non-refurbished B777\'sCabin Crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us, I was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above myHowever and this is a big however, your second meal we were given a Breakfast Bar, that was disgraceful! How much of a budget are they on now? I thoughtat their cookies in disgraceI just can\'t believe how downhill BA has goneIt\'s incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too, I think they\'re running out of moneyUnfortunately I booked my flights to Marrakech before this expereince, and I promise that would be the last time I fly with BA.\r\n\r\nSeats are narrow, seat cushions are hard, and I had a "large" person next to me both tripsI paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossibleI was delayed in Montreal for 5+ hours (never given a reason why), stuck in the aircraft from 9 pm until 3am cause customs was closedHad to wait another 6 hours at HeathrowMissed my connection to Athens and my connection from Athens to CyprusWas never offered accomodation or compensationI followed up and never got a replyClearly I am being ignoredI will never use British Airways again.desperate need of refurbishment (particularly the horrible toilets)No priority boarding, all bussed like sardines on the long journey to T3 where the plane was satReturn, no lounge, no voucher to compensate for no lounge, no priority security, no priority boardingI was and still am disgusted, what a rip off! How do they get away with it? Answer, people like me pay excessive air fares to fly with them, wellnot any more, disgraceful, they should be ashamed.I had not flown with British Airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to Dublin from London Heathrow Terminal 5getting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time, I thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning whenOn the app I noticed that the flight had been delayed by approxWhen I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printingqueue (bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off) I was told that theflight has been closed and as I was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and I ca not fly on that flight soAfter discussing with the check in manager I was told that there is nothing he can do as he doesn\'t make the rulesIf this is how the BA customers are to be treated, i.ethey have to be there on time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then I for one will most definitely not be flying BAagain, the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it seems in this case (they are not putting any value on my /we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late ).Having used Avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advanceBritish Airways policy of offering a "fun size" Mars bar instead of a second meal is unacceptableIn our opinion the airline are offering a "budget experience" at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them.Tired old aircraft, seat would not fully recline unlike the person in front of meEntertainment system is dreadful and flickeered most of the trip - I did not even use it much in the endNo Wifi or charging facilities onboard.I declined that, and stayed hungryFast Track through security at LHR Terminal 5 is a misnomerBoarding aircraft a nightmareKnees against the sear in front unless one sits with a twisted spine (not good)Overall not what one expects from Business Class and negates any positive aspect of the flight.I expected better and this was not value for moneyAdvance seat selection is expensive, just plain gouging on top of ticket priceAfter arriving in London we started out with a 5 hour delay due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn Boeing 772Planes were swapped and we left on yet another shabby and worn B772Seats were comfortable but the aircraft was dirtyBA has cut back on the amenities in World travellerOverall I was disappointedBut what has happened? This used to be a great airline, which now sadly is nothing more than a low cost carrier charging premium prices12 hour flight delayed 1 hour due to no cleanersAdvised by First officer that Cabin Crew had to clean the plane! Crumbs on seat and greasy windowsOtherwise fairly average flight until woken up 2 hours out of Mauritius to be advised that toilets on plane were full and no further use please! Just after waking upOne hour out First Officer came on again with further abject apology re toilets not working as apparently the toilet tanks hadn\'t been emptied at LGW before departureTwo hours with legs crossed for over 200 pax! Surely flight should never have departed without emptying tanksThey knock US airlines into a cocked hat and I should know as I had the bitter experience during my stateside trip.I do not normally write reviews but I was so disappointed with the service and flights from BA for a recent 4 night stay in a Dubai with my wife,Some of the staff (not all) were rude and they had run out of food when they came to serve meTired, worn interior and the food reflected this tooInbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent serviceMy last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing, they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoyI then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so, so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I hadThey now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights, I even had to purchase a bottle of waterThis is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the fares are still much more expensiveHaving eventually dug out the right customer services number (these were not provided on the email) I tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so longI eventually gave up.British Airways has started charging inflated prices for food, on a flight that is already highly priced in comparison to other airlines, The standard is pathetic, and it is nosurprise that the flight was emptyThey are just a very expensive EasyJet / Ryanair.Never had need to write a bad airline review before nowBritish Airways was the worst airline I have ever flown withOld shabby and dirty planeTv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when I arrivedThe seat I then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back (old food stains) and on the beltAwful and rude staff (with exception of one)Worst airline by far I have ever flown with.Firstly couldn\'t book myself in online - my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but I couldn\'t move him, his seat was fixedFood and seats terribleI have complained twice re check in, meals and the broken tray table on the return trip, and have been offered 5000 Avios points (\xc2\xa340) that just ties me intoflying with them again, especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want to use them! The cutbacks are a cut too far BAThe flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit togetherThe food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flightMy main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very wellThere was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn\'tThe catering was really disgusting thoughTruly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been servedI thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every waySad and disappointing.Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company againI called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British AirwaysAs soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me,I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaosBoarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competitionThis was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared toI asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten aboutThe arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too smallOverall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options.While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exudedwas extremely disappointingproviding alternatives or compensation for my troublesIn this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or theinconvenience put upon meWhen I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told "no, this is not possible" without any explanationis not possible"After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstancesMy answer was a to be handed a \xc2\xa375 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under nosort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself asI am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline.In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passengerThere is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flightsAvios and Tier Point awards have been slashedI will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.\r\nBritish Airways is no longer good value for moneyThe cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exerciseThe plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don\'t really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experienceParticular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra \xc2\xa340-\xc2\xa355 eachThe food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabinThe tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while)For almost double the price of Economy, I don\'t think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route.make it they can\'t overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control andWillie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laughBA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only haveOn our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descentand the loos were effectively out of useSeems like a structural flaw in their offeringThe other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to theBBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reasonCabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their mealThroughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinksBritish Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacksBritish Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offeringThe catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaoticThis return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I\'ve ever takenI gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn\'t focus on itBritish Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else.Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an embarrassmentThe domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration -very unprofessionalSorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals "Budget Airline" just about sums it all upThat aside there is little benefits to flying say RyanairThe options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the placeNow they don\'tWe pushed back 10 minutes earlyThe now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparentlyI read the BA "Brochure" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I\'d ever readNow you don\'tThe return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammedSome booze and snacks - nothing edibleFlight delayed by 30 minutesPlane was rammedAfternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn\'t look like sconesHopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as \xc2\xa3600 returnAll in all - another disappointing experience from the "World\'s most frugal Airline".The food options on this flight were not of the usual standard I would expect of business classThe starter of melon and cucumber was poorThe chicken main was overcooked and lacked any flavorHowever, the FA attending to my wife lacked experience and it showedMy broken headphone was replaced within seconds of me telling one of the crew, when my wife\'s breakfast selection was apparently not available it was rapidly located at a differentI pre-paid for my seat and their system assigned a wrong seatI called customer service 6 times and no one helped me the get this fixedBritish Airways customer service is the worst airline customer service I\'ve seenI would be happy to pay extra next time not to travel with British Airways.As for the food menu? The food is so expensive and it\'s easy to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these pricesAn airline should not represent a country when it\'s based on profit above it\'s peopleAt least Ryanair etc are honest and cheap! British Airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole !\r\nSadly British Airways is now a very poor quality budget airline that still thinks it is a top end carrierThe aircraft are generally old, shabby and dirtyThe staff are surly and abrupt, the seating cramped and uncomfortableI am a business travelled and would prefer to fly Club Europe but I am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economyIt is a joke - if the person in front reclines I can\'t work - so how is this in any way business class.I don\'t know why I chose to fly BA - a sense of nostalgia I thinkI will not do so againBlank look and total non-helpfulnessWhen I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bagsOn the way back - forget itFirstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn\'t the \'for airline use only\' at the front - it was row 11! WhenI asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the planeDone with bad graceThey then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 minsThe breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever hadI have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortableYes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta andGenerally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabbyI\'m embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre servicesOverall - it\'s sad.I have flown a lot with British Airways and other airlines and am constantly amazed at BA\'s bad reviewsDue to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to Heathrow, which I may add both my wife and I checked twice when booking the tickets wasWe couldn\'t prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get homeThe staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, "no nothing could be done"To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chanceWe had no choice (over a barrel) scarcity value I hear you cry, noWe boarded to find that the flight was less than half fullMy wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn\'t their fault but they were dumbstruck themselvesTo cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedibleWe will never fly BA againBritish Airways - the worlds biggest rip off.There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen)I\'ve been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointmentI was late to the airport due to delays on the train lineCalled customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn\'t do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airportIt was incorrectHe was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying businessAt the gate, we had a late boarding because \'the computer wasn\'t working\' Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishmentMy headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn\'t stay in positionThe entertainment system was poorIt started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the \'noise cancelling\' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out andit doesn\'t make a differenceOverall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfastSorry BA but you are stuck in the 80s and you\'re slipping further down my list of preferences.\r\nWe were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-inThe next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refusedI have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn\'t in the futureNext up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flightMy IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sitChoice of starter also not available but that was no big dealDreadful, stressful experience for people who\'d paid a lot of moneyHave been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissiveThey were not rude, but not willing to be helpful or go out of their way to make a good impressionI fly very often, not often with BA so thought I\'d try it, and now realized they do not compare with other major airlines.My major issue with British Airways economy is their penny pinchingYou sit down, there is no welcome snack - you then have your meal and  seven hours later if you are hungry, you have to pay for basic snacksIt\'s ridiculousBA has no other major advantages, so sadly, why use them?Now that BA have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airlineOver the last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airlineThat said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating furtherHowever, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30minsThis does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toiletsHowever, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economyMy sympathies go to the staff, because I fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain toThe prices were even below airport onesThe bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could get yourorder - well, you can\'t compete with Ryanair trying to do better the things they do bestLosing an identity can cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free.I feel it was the worst airline so far compared to othersCan you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 3.5-hour flight from Istanbul to LondonWhat is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water? Also, from London to Vancouver, we delayed almost 2 hours because of luggage issues and a passenger didnot feel well and he had to leave the plane, which could be understandable this partBut, the plane was old Boeing 747, the screens were very bad quality and smallThe name of the company is big but quality of the service is far below than averageIt was enough trouble for me not to select BA in my flights in the future.Filthy dirty, tired Boeing 777-200 to ChicagoFood absolutely terrible, and service from crew hurried and disinterestedIFE movies limited selection, and slowThis is an airline in declineThey don\'t care because of limited competition across the AtlanticFinally, their First Class lounge at Heathrow was dirty and worn.\r\nhad got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up - it took them 1 hour to fix the plane didn\'ttell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags! I gave up my seat 38D for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so I got 40D- big mistake! Seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping downIt was the coldest plane I have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets I was that cold I took the blanket put it over myToilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flightThey had to manually reset everyone\'s screens, they were very old, the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desiredNot to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lagThe interior on the seating was old and lumpy I\'m sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw! They don\'t even have USB\'s to chargethe years this is by far the worst!I flew to South Africa this time last year with Virgin on their new B787 and it was a nightmareUnfortunately, they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flightPoor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it\'s last legsThe most disorganised boarding ever with few PAsI asked for sparking wine but it\'s only done on flights from London - (crew explained it can\'t be chilled at outstations - (poor excuse given they do it forPoor salad, and a nasty dry piece of cakeBut no muffin or even a biscuit - really poorNorth Lounge was an average experience, ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refreshUnfortunately, the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by BAFast off the plane, and despite slow immigration, the bags beat me againOverall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitorsThe meal is nowhere near Club standard and its the cutting of the small things - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the mostBe competitive but don\'t take it out on me! I wouldn\'t mind but the prices don\'t go down with the reduction of serviceBA need to listen to what we\'re saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as bad as the budget airlinesEventually the hardiest of us loyal BA customers will give up and move airline / alliance and that would be a shame.Not willing to pay an extra \xc2\xa38, I was allocated a middle seat right at the rearWithin a minute a burly employee told me I had to check in my cabin bag, saying "you should not believe what is said on the company\'s website"How very true! Some ten other passengers, equally perplexed suffered the same fateAll in all a demeaning experienceOnly a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink (the deceptive "upgrade" we were sold at the beginning of the year)I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointmentBasically it does not workEven soft drinks are chargeable - I don\'t think this is acceptableThere was a 20-25 minute wait time for thisThis was extremely slowCEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy,told I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t as the flight had been oversoldI was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselvesI was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisorNone was available nor could be contacted, apparentlyI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight \xe2\x80\x9cin case\xe2\x80\x9d a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it inI was told to wait for another 20 minutesI argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flightI was treated as a nuisanceAt one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there \xe2\x80\x98waiting\xe2\x80\x99 and being ignoredI informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to dealI had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customerI then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airportAs I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contemptUnder their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even thoughSome would call this cheatingSleeping on overnight flights in economy class is an ordeal in itself, bit I was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing - we had just entered FrenchI was shocked.However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it\'s all part of the Business ClassWith the very confusing layout that greets one in the South Terminal now that BA have moved in, the \'serve yourself\' check-in (you even label your own bags!)I was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the \'Lounge\'But then to be greeted with this, was totally unacceptableSo, Willie, rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this sort of display of overt cost-cutting has now lost you revenue for the futureShort-sighted management or what? Take a lesson from Emirates who I decided to fly home with, so disgusted was I over our experienceLondon Heathrow to Vancouver return.Both flights were punctual but sadly the 747-400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age, especially compared to the A380sThe cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flightThe IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offeringsIt is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped Terminal 3 at HeathrowNo real gripes although the "snack" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffeeLoads of interactive channels to watch but films weren\'t the best but that\'s a personal thing.Underneath there were lots of litterWe then realized that we can\'t watch movies etc due to fact that there was no soundOur other complaint was the food - it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few timesIn short I would not recommend flying with BA.Boarding on time but held in tarmac for half an hour, not BA\'s faultThe pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minutes to have lost the allotted time, so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stairDon\'t waste your money buying BA seat assignments in advance! I did that a month ago, at the same time as I made my booking, and paid for an aisleWhen I went back one week before my journey, my aisle seat was gone and I was placed in an undesirable middle seatThere was no remedy for thisFive calls over three days to BA connected me to people in Delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately, sorry, and just noI have been deceived, lied to, and put offIt is acceptable to make an error, but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify itBritish Airways has unfortunately declined badly.The quality of British Airways has most certainly gone downhillWe boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat (E) so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flightWithout notice, we had to go through de-icing which meant a 45min delay to our service (we did however catch up 35mins)Due to slot restrictions at Rome and London, this flight was also delayedDuring both flights the new buy on board was poorly done, taking forever with a limited range of overpriced productsnothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless serviceWhat a shame.Heathrow to Seattle was on a B777-200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped, making it impossible to sleep on a 9-10hr flightOnline check-in wasn\'t possible and we weren\'t able to select our seats as our booking had an Iberia flight number even though it was operated by BAMade lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airportArrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and I didn\'t get our seats together - ground staff could do nothing about itFood was bland to say the least - possibly the worse on any carrier I\'ve ever flown withThe whole experience was poor flying from London Heathrow to AthensAncient aircraft (767), poor inflight entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food was very slow and lacking some of the very limited range of productsOn short haul, and Athens at 4 hours is classified as this, BA is now a low cost carrier without the efficiency of the more established low cost carriersThis airline is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time until a largely loyal customer base deserts them for alternative airlines.For a start the Club world seats are not comfortableThe cabin crew were indifferentI was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flightI did complain immediately to BA and to their credit, I received a response - basically they were sorry I felt this wayNever againPay a fortune for this basic service.Will never touch British Airways againHaving flown BA on this route from Orlando to London Heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhillI have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life! As well as this the seats were old and the screens didn\'t workI\'ve been flying with BA regularly for last 4 years and I can\'t get my head around what is going onComplimentary drinks replaced with a Buy on Board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now!  Really just appallingThere is no competition on the LBA route, but I certainly won\'t pay anything extra to travel with BA from now on if there are alternatives available - Ryanair itOn 12/31/16 at 5pm the night before my flight, I received an email saying that my first leg to London had been cancelled and I needed to call to rescheduleHowever, to book this he gave up my other seatI asked if British Airways would comp my hotel for their mistakeHe had no answerHe refused to book me on any other airlineI asked for a manager he said there were none availableI fought with BA from 5pm until 1am (no exaggeration, I have screeenshots of the phone calls)I decided to get up at 6am, go to the airport, and talk with a BA rep - only to find out they have no BA reps but a repAs a business who has inconvenienced me shouldHowever, she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and I had to individually check in to each oneThe check-in associate also failed to do soTherefore, when the stewardess for AirBerlin was 30 minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit, I had to run to the next gate only to find out Iwasn\'t checked in so they gave my seat awayIt took another 2 weeks to get it backAt the end of it, BA left me in a $400 deficit (had to get home to CA from Philly) I contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear back and all they had to say was that they couldn\'t do anything for meNext time I will spend however much more it costs to fly with an airline who has some form of management overseeing their employees and I know will not screwThe new food and drink service is appallingThe crew on our flight never made it to the last 8 or so rows, so my children (sat at the back) went thirstyThis was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere - clearly that is not BA\'s fault, but it is theirfault that I couldn\'t then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the planeI doubt we\'ll notice any difference.The onboard service continues to decline for passengers in BA World Traveller - terrible food, minimal drinks and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wineYou get the feeling that if you so much as ask for anything other than the bare minimum you will be restrained and arrested on arrival at your destinationSeat was okay, better comfort than American Airlines I have to say but the movie selection and TV selection was poor as usual with random selections of TV programmes whichare interrupted continually by onboard announcementsUnimpressed with the new M&S on board serviceBoarding process badly organised and the cabin crew cabin bags (quite a few) were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their bagsIt\'s not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines, but sadly I booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard.45 minute delay on the tarmacAir conditioning wasn\'t working during delay - would only work once engines were onThe cabin was therefore unbearably hotThe foam in my seat 30B had deteriorated to the point I could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail boneI informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn\'t be moved and so I was given an extra pillowThis is a 12 hour flight and I don\'t think this is acceptableI was very uncomfortable during this flightIn flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blippingConsidering the price of flights, I think this is very poorBritish Airways is not a budget airlineThere were two in flight meals on this flight - on both occasions I was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run outOnce, I could forgive - but twice? When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of theflight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that \'I was travelling to a poor country and I shouldHow rude! I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staffThe quality of the meals have dropped dramaticallyWhat is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake (both of which I intensely dislike)This is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsettingI\'d had no choice in your menu, and what was served up was unpalatableAn additional charge on an already expensive flight is a \'hard pill to swallow\'.Before we even left BA changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying usTo cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo! On complainingat the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refundI was told \'they are always doing this\'I wrote to the Chief Executive, no acknowledgement, nothingI wrote to the Refunds Department, no acknowledgement, nothingI chased Customer Services again and was told the Refund Department is so busyI will never fly with BA againTo quote British Airway Customers Service response "I completely understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re unhappy you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your preferred seatsI apologise for the inconvenience caused to youThe seat rests do not come up all the way but this was the only annoyanceNot sure if I like the new charges for food on the European legs - 5GBP was steep for coffee and tea in plastic cups.The flight got cancelled due to bad weather at IST, this is understood, but when we tried to reschedule the flight, we faced a mess and nightmare with the staffwho did not know how or what they should do as Istanbul airport was shut due to snowWe nearly got rebooked on a flight to Munich which we refused as BA ticketing agent did not know that the Turkish incoming flight to Munich was cancelled - Ihad to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to Munich where we would have got strandedAthens being delayed by nearly 21 hourstold No assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed helpwere cancelledI asked for a refund of part of the ticket, I received a general reply without any joy! British Airways need to look around you and learn from other airlines,All which are missing with BA.I expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation.As a former Executive Gold card holder (7 years running), my long haul travels had stopped due to change of job so sadly lost my status, back to "blue"Sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now (economy) but the wines are not good (I am a wine trade professional)I am concerned, though, to read the generally appalling comments about BA\'s long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight, inMy only complaint was that the inbound flight was 7 minutes past scheduled time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting flightBA should never book connections with such a tight scheduleProblem was compounded by disinterested ground staff, especially a BA manager at T5 who was more interested in continuing a conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who was helpingBritish Airways has stooped to its lowest level of penury by introducing a well-marketed and poorly executed scheme of M& S Tie-up on catering in European and Domestic routesBA is where a passenger has to remain thirsty for even a 3 hr flight to far Europe destination without a credit or debit cardStooped to lowest levels of customer service from being a renowned airlineThis must be brand suicide at its worstThe brand is now cheapened, the offering before wasn\'t gourmet, but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit, now you can\'t even get hot waterWhat ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by British Airways in every single class you travel, yet you don\'t see a decrease in ticket pricesThe positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly , but I do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them.The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlinesThe continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flightCheck-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a "computer glitch" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processesThere were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassedBA needs to speed up bag drop urgentlyThe lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availabilityNot a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standardsThe flight was not good at allCabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flightSadly BA is no longer my airline of choiceSorry BA but you\'ve lost my loyaltyClub World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you\'ve lost the plot to the bean countersreally fault what was providedEvery leg of my British Airways flight was delayed including one which was delayed due to a "paperwork issue that would take 10 minutes"Late inbound flights caused me to miss my connection which British Airways charged me exorbitant fees and wait in a 4 hour line to rebookInflight entertainment audio system did not work properly, which was not resolved and offered no compensation as a resultBy far the worst travel my wife or I have ever experienced, we will be avoiding this airline for life.Zurich to London Heathrow, and my first trip on BA since they scrapped any type of complimentary service onboard for us lowly economy cabin travellersThis is now some weeks on since they introduced their buy onboard snack options, but cabin staff acted like it was their first day and that they had no trainingOkay, it might not be easy for them, but they all appeared very bad tempered with customer questions about the new Ryanair style service, and a lot of tutting asI am sick and tired of the CEO of BA telling us everywhere this is what their customers asked forThat said, it seems the BA reputation is on the slide across many markets, and that\'s where shareholders should be truly worriedGatwick to Barcelona return, and just dreadful pretty much sums up this British Airways business class experienceSince BA moved to Gatwick south terminal, their new lounge is still not readyWhat a sorry state this lounge wasFull, with limited seating, a forty minute wait for food, no available snacks and empty drinks cabinetsThis meal was completely insufficientI found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spendAfter being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flightThe flight was on time, but British Airways has slipped to low budget airline standardsI cannot score more than 1 even for cabin crew, as I didn\'t receive any service onboardAlmost 3 hour flight and not one question or moment of attention from the cabin crewCrew is not guilty, they are victims of the new airline policiesBA just lost it\'s Class.I don\'t enjoy having to pay for something that was once available for free, but sometimes there are compensationsSadly this was not the caseThe seats were uncomfortable and the video screens were about half the size of an iPad and definitely looked as if they were 20 years oldHow British Airways have fallen in their service and product - they are no better than Ryanair now and frankly unless LHR is convenient to you, I would seek anotherNot even a drink offered unless you pay although another passenger stated water was free but it was not offeredSeats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anythingI checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that I immediately ripped offThe only benefit was my frequent flier tier meant I got early boarding, this is my last trip through LHR as the connection procedure is so awfulInflight food shockingSecond year running no choice just a pastaFor an eight + hour flight appallingBA should be ashamed and/or put another Ten pounds on the ticket and give a proper mealHave flown Virgin, Thomas Cook etc outstandingly BA the worstHow the mighty have fallen, or should I say continue to fallIt was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage nearto our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag,Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced "here is your vegetable lasagne" rather than explaining that for our \xc2\xa31700they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whetherwasn\'t happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a resultthe passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BAif they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full costIn summary, I eventually was offered \xc2\xa315 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don\'t fly that often, even \xc2\xa315 shopping vouchers and an apology wouldhave been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it\'s onboard service and the same for it\'s customer relations which arrogantly doesn\'t give a damnLooking back, the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me.After a disorganized boarding, the door of the aircraft was closed 15 minutes lateThen the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure, because of fog in the morning at Heathrow AirportThanks to the delay we spent more then two and a half hour on a BA plane and we did not receive a free glass of water.Fairly chaotic check in, largely down to the Iberia staffInflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos startedThe time they were taking for each row they served was excruciatingthey said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got themThis was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etcWhat a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary serviceSad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of Lufthansa and Air France.On return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog, but rebooking had been done by the time I checked in in PHL and I had a text message alsoThe decline of British AirwaysToday BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggageToday, within Europe, BA has absolutely no advantage opposite EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even RyanairWhy should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling pointsPreviously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboardAnd now NO CUPBOARDS! Extra seats insteadThe Decline and Fall of a once proud BAThe seat I had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toiletI never got an explanation for this actionAlso, the flight was dirty, the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first placeI went to claim my luggage at the carousel, I waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and I couldn\'t find my luggage which had my weddingAs you can imagine I was devastated, I had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issueMy luggage never arrived the next dayMyself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding itemsThe BA staff at the airport weren\'t helpful at all, they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggageMy luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shapeUp till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven\'t refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with themBA ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and I have vowed to never fly with BA.Having previously flown BA First Class on the Boeing 777 and A380, this trip on an ageing Boeing 747-400 from Heathrow Terminal 3 was disappointingI had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats, which looked more like BA\'s dreadful Club World seatsThe first disappointment came after pre-booking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying, we would getWhy? There are only 14 First Class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few AVIOS as compensation! The IFE screen qualitywas poor and the movie selection not particularly goodBA need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competitionPriority boarding is a joke; anybody with a Bronze Executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gatesub-par most of the BA experience has becomeAirport service at Heathrow distinctly average and economy styleOnboard, some staff friendly, some surly and frankly lazyLoos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flightTrouble is there is no proper competition on this route, as US carriers can\'t be classified in the first class league.LHR-JNB, BA055 on 20th January was an absolute disgraceGreat aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight serviceThese attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours - this on a night flightAnd a further huge gap between the meal service being startedAll the while being delivered by the most miserable steward I\'ve ever had the displeasure to encounterShe acknowledged that these new crews are \'inexperienced\' and I said that\'s no excuse for rudenessWhy can BA not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service? Later had the pleasure of flying JNB-CPTI\'ve checked the Recommend box - but if you are on a night flight with the new contract crew, avoid themThe aeroplane was old and tired, uncomfortable seats, overhead TV screens which can hardly be viewed from the seats we had choseMy headphones did not work in the seat eitherBut apart from it being a somewhat OK ish journey the offering of food and drink was shockingWe can only choose food and drink from a Marks and Spencer\'s booklet, believe me the food is not up to M&S quality, they should never have put their goodWhilst I accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems, the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit cardwhich had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shamefulWhat on earth are BA thinking about? British Airways are seriously letting themselves down badlyWe felt like low budget airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets M&S, don\'t spoil your good reputation with this venture.Staff on the London to San Jose flight was good but not warm or personalPossibly the worst customer service and flight attendants ever, both outward and inward flightThe plane was dirty, old and smellyThe cabin crew were rude, unhelpful with their customer service who simply ignore your complaintsThe experience can only be described as appallingThe business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminalThis meant it was overcrowded and dirty (through no fault of the regular staffThey just could not keep up with the number of passengers)We could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised BA staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats freeThe BA ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits endThe flight was mediocre to say the leastThe food was average and the service satisfactoryHaving paid \xc2\xa32000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good serviceThis is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with British Airways, we will be travelling Virgin even if it means we have to get severalFlew British Airways from Miami to London Heathrow on 15th January and the aircraft was filthy in Economy classOpened the armrest to retrieve table and the dirt was disgusting, this has been an accumulation over a long period of timeTV didn\'t work and after 3 hours into a 8.5 hour flight and the attendant trying to re-boot it 3 times I finally asked what could be doneThere was a seat free in Business class but the Manager on the flight made it clear that he was \'not allowed\' to move meI traveled business class on the outbound flight on 3rd Jan but did not feel that it was value for moneyI logged this complaint onboard at the time but a week later still heard nothing, doesn\'t surprise me.London Heathrow to Dubai, and a delayed flightPoor communications from LHR British Airways staffHorrible foodUnmotivated crewA disgrace and sad to have experienced, and will avoid them.On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passengerhaul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to LondonUnfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (whichIt didn\'t stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was "well, get a bus"Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the managerWas told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complainGave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed againSpoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating "go online, I don\'t care about BA"When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flightComplained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensationGeneric reply after 5 minutes was, no compensationNeedless to say, I will never fly with BA again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who I frequently fly with in business class and amNot fair for the fareNot allowed to choose our seatsThe cabin was not clean (lot of dust)8 seats per row in Business, no privacy, 50% of the seats don\'t have direct access to the aisleBad meals in small portionsNot enough toiletsTiny PTV screen and poor movie selectionWe had to face the bad mood of the ground staff in London who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the London toWe explained that we were in Business class and that we flew with the same cases at the beginning of our vacation, they didn\'t care and refused us to bring30 minutes of stress because they didn\'t do their job properlyWon\'t fly BA again, except for the cabin crew everything was bad and looking like budget airline.Absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flightNo idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flightPretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly.Yesterday I was coming back from Bangkok to London and I missed my flight, because I feel asleep at the airport (I had a sleepless night and food poisoning)Galleries lounge at T3 tatty and overcrowdedIFE long past its due replacement date, with small screen and poor resolutionMeal the usual sub-standard BA fare, with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mainsHotel Chocolat chocs have now disappearedFood options dreadful, with the worst hot food we\'ve encountered in any business class loungeMeal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfastWould I fly in British Airways First again? NoWould I fly with British Airways again? NoThe 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessionalThe supplied headphone set was faulty and did not workI had to ask twice for a replacement setIt took over 40 minutes to receive thisI had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arriveThere were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be servedIt took over 2 hours to get my dinnerI was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order)This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew memberThere were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfastI ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this orderI was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayedThe First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flightSubsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer RelationsNo attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaintThis was disappointingI responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had beenThe response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture ofI found this statement somewhat ironic.I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where BA got this market research to say stop complementary meals, we prefer to pay for it ! I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to find anyone who agrees with thisI suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true, though I suspect the real reason is cost cutting, BA just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit itBA would be better off to admit it, customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removingbenefit and keeping price the same, we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no goodTo tell me that charging \xc2\xa31.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when I can buy the same thing in Tesco for 63p insults my intelligence, they areexploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market, again a great image to promote to the worldWhere possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a BA passenger where any alternative existsPay extra for checked luggage, Pay extra for drinks, pay extra for food, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to thatYou do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flightThere was also nowhere to plug in laptops, which you expect on a long and expensive flight-especially when you have work to doThe plane was also so cold (too cold to concentrate on work)Shanghai to Zurich via London return, and British Airways is absolutely appallingI have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airlineOn the way there, the flight to Zurich was cancelled due to French strike, not BA\'s fault so that part is clearHowever, they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled, furthermore, they ran out of hotels to put people up and wewasted about 5 hours (after a 12 hours flight) to go through customs (thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers), find a hotel, arrange ourSo the first leg already left a terrible impressionThen, on the way back to Shanghai, they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I to economy for aI booked premium economy for a reason, my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? NoTold us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat, then at boarding, told us sorry it\'s either fly economy nowThree months down the track, I have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbers/emails to write to, onlyan impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black holeNeedless to say I will forever boycott BA for its incompetence and insincerity towards a paying customer.The outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all - food crumbs around seat area, stained carpets, wet toilet floors etcWhen the food was served we had been noted as \'not eating\' - when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess, the two hotoptions were unavailable - I had cheese and biscuits and my husband went withoutThe quality of the video/audio was very poor - the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchableDuring the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum - not a very professional image! On our return the only response by BA to our complaints wasadditional Avios Points - an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of.The queue was ridiculous for bag drop and I had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag! The queue for assisted check in was far quicker \xe2\x80\x93British Airways were completely under staffed and disorganisedTotal failI kept checking the flight details for any planned delays - it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow, etc, but the monitor andThe flight was terrible but that\'s another storyI see no point at flying with BA (for a few years now)Staff are old and \'entitled\'When you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft, you are presented with filthy dirty seatsFood getting worse and worse, and in board entertaining \xe2\x80\x93 almost non-existentBA used to be good not just an ordinary lazy airline living from its glories.The communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room, only to learn they still hadn\'t rebooked my flightWhile waiting in line, I tried multiple times to call their customer service number, and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to internationalcell phone costsThe rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land, and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioningI landed almost a day later than planned, but my bag didn\'t make it from London for another four daysBritish Airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses they\'d reimburse, yet then denied portions of my claimThe delays, lost baggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holidaySuch a horrible experience with this airline, will never fly them again!Flight from Athens to Heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the "norm" for this flight with BAHowever a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight, no explanation as to the reasonif they are happy to pay airport pricesI had no idea that BA are now charging for food and drink even for water (they kept that one quiet)I rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat (they kept that one quiet as well when thisHow long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as RyanairBased on who`s opinion exactly? See no point in using BA nowThey have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriersWith this latest money grabbing scam I will change my scheduling to avoid themThere are plenty other quality carriers who like BA are struggling to maintain profitsAll have the same threat of terrorism, fluctuating oil prices, adverse weather, air-traffic control strikes etcSomeone please explain to me what the difference is with Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian now? It\'s become a budget airline and I for one won\'t be using them anymore ifThey cut the Avios for flights, made it more difficult to go up tiers and now this joke? I\'m not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest butThen when I wanted to buy a sandwich I was told that there were only 3 for the entire plane and they sold outSalad then? Sold outSome crisps? Unfortunately the person in front of me got the last bagStop this nonsense pleaseI will avoid BA like the plague now, sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until they become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits.The service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flightThis meant there was no upper deck seatingThe cabin was drab and dated; the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited; the food was, for business class, not particularly good quality and poorly presented - inIn summary the experience compared very badly to Asian or Middle Eastern airlines I\'ve used.\r\nThis latest British Airways trip from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth just confirms how standards are slippingWe may not be Gold or Silver members, but we don\'t deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW leg was booked by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase anSubsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get throughThe Executive Club customer service link just sends you round in circles! A formal emailed complaint through "Contact us" resulted in "we\'re sorry to hear you\'ve had problems" - butno solution offered9year old daughter hungry, no nibblesWhen asked, steward responded "well, that\'s cutbacks for you"No snacks available for children for 5 hours! "Cutbacks"And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child\'s meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child\'s lunch, very ungraciouslyNo hint of an apologyThrough no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major road accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for thenext bus \xe2\x80\x93 my friend and I missed our 18.30 flight to Hong Kong on December 12thWe were then offered 3 options \xe2\x80\x93 pay a supplement of \xc2\xa31478 to take the 20.50 flight, take a downgrade to Premium Economy WITHOUT a guarantee that BA would reimburseThe BA official couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been less flexible or sympathetic, and BA has responded to my complaint via Twitter with the same disinterestAny pleasure she might have got from it, and mine in giving it to her, were ruined by the way we were treatedOn the (half-empty) flight back on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve the crew obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there, was barely courteous, and when my friend, a diabetic, enquired what would beThey clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, eitherGod knows how the poor souls in the back were treatedSadly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they deserve my custom any longer, so the next time we fly to Asia we will take one of the Gulf airlines who at least giveBA\xe2\x80\x99s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever come across, and their corporate motto \xe2\x80\x98To Fly To Serve\xe2\x80\x99an embarrassing jokeI\xe2\x80\x99ve flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing it again unless it can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be avoidedThe saddest thing of all is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think British Airways will give a damn.I do not eat on flights, so I thought BA\'s decision to charge for food was not gonna upset me too muchTo my surprise I am not allowed to get hot water anymore! In fact I am not allowed to get any water on BA shorthaul flight unless I pay (evenSo not only they didn\'t lower the fare, but they also sucessfully joined budget airline bunch by charging even for water! To my great regret they are the only airlineBut if I am to fly on holiday, British Airways will not be my chosen carrier ever again.The check-in queues in Amman were annoying but, other than that, this London-Amman-London trip reminded me of how flying used to be.Outbound flight was delayed due to engine problem just before taking off with consequent 5 hours delaysTwo hours late, and terrible service when able to boardThe flight attendants seemed too young, and they did not care to anyones concernsI now see why, British Airways has lost it class, they really don\'t care about the customerI can honestly say I will never fly British Airways again, no matter if they are the lowest priced carrier.We were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to BarbadosI was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a trayI looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut backsHad a painful 13 hour fight as I had a window seat with a metal box in the leg room areas, which meant my feet were slanted to one sideOn my way back, the inflight entertainment didn\'t workAfter numerous attempts to reset by the cabin crew it still didn\'t work for my partner and IFor the price of the ticket this was not acceptable.I\'m always reminded that British Airways is one of the worst airlines every time I fly with themThe check in service is as bad as they getTo make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn\'t becausePoor food on long haul flightsStruggling to think of many ways they could be worseA real embarrassment that British Airways is my country\'s main airline.I went to the trouble of checking in online, printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my bag at the airport, to be told that is not allowed!After 1 hour in the horrific queue, I am told there is "no space for a bag drop at Manchester T3"British Airways disgust me with this hoop-jumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feetLiving in London, and flying international long haul flights throughout the year I have once again been disappointed by British Airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabinsMy seat would not reclineThe flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me toSadly, he did not(I currently have 588,500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to use)My comfort was not metI\'ve flown this route (Sydney to London) many times with other airlines and British Airways is the worstThey changed our seats during the fuel stop at Singapore - without notice, without explanationThe food was terrible - no fruit or green vegetable to be seenToilet locations on board are terrible - those poor people seated right next to the WC doorPaid extra for reserved seats - no confirmationInflight entertainment was awful - really, really old moviesDon\'t risk it - you\'ll be disappointed.BA is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cuttingNot convenientThe movie selection was very poorThe meal was bad and quantity was very poor3 tiny toilets for the business class, not enough.London Heathrow to Hong Kong was the most disappointing business class experienceThe seats on BA are narrow, lack privacy (the face of a stranger next to me facing in the opposite direction was about 2 feet, 60 cm, from me) anddon\'t even dream about any storage space (I couldn\'t find a flat surface to place my eyeglasses on, and I kept my water bottle on the floor under the seat)The entire experience was so irritating that I didn\'t know whether I should complain or just laugh at itI have no idea how BA can get away with thisThey certainly won\'t see me as a customer again.I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erraticPriority bags beat me to the baggage beltThe only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds, two whites and no RoseAfternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones droppedNo delays on departure and well ordered boarding, but despite the smiles, British Airways staff just can\'t quite reach out to passengers as was the Norwegian experienceTired, grey Boeing 777 interior doesn\'t help eitherOkay the rudiments of a service are there but come on, who decided no alcoholic drinks served with dinner or replace the afternoon tea with a box of sickly snacksI suppose this is the best we can expect but with so called low cost airlines doing so much better, the main carriers deserve to lose ground.On my way home on 1st January 2017 (Athens to LHR) the flight BA633 had 3 hours delayed departureNo headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and  I had a fault on the lights above the seatsThis airline is going down fast and I will be happy to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputationI will try not to fly them againThey are worse than RyanairBA has the logo to fly to serve I think it should be changed: to fly to rip off and make your lives a hell on the air.The Boeing 747-400 was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolutionAll and all not a bad experience - but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experienceI flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features, entertainment, food and comfort. I was disappointed with the lack of food provided by British Airways on this flightThe Muslim meal was really not nice at all, and I should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice! I wasBritish Airways just don\'t seem to be in the same league as others such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Virgin etc.The worst breakfast I\'ve ever hadIn my view they are nothing specialComing back from my honeymoon, me and my wife had our luggage misplaced and is missing over the holidays, 3 weeks of clothes in our suitcases, and no one isI can\'t even get a hold of anyone in their offices to speak to in regards to a claim? Everyone says to do it online, sure and how long isit going to take for someone to get back to me? This is not a way to handle customersI will make sure to never fly on British Airways again.Having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways and their First Class product I was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like onOur domestic connecting flight from MAN-LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at LHR, the Captain came into the Gate area and explained the reasons of the delayAfter an hour into the journey, the twins started to cryThe twins continued crying as they didn\'t eat the main mealI went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored! Eventually a Steward came to collect a trolley for Business class and saw me waiting andThe cabin staff would rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated, tired, hungry childrenhas lost my custom and I won\'t be flying with BA ever again!BA 869 from Budapest on 17th December was delayed by fog at HeathrowI had never known that kind of communication before with delays"Bad start for my first trip on British AirwaysFlight delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical problemSo for the insult of paying for reasonable seats, my wife and I were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft - no refund, just shoulder shrugs aboutThis caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at HeathrowOverall a loss of a half dayThinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wastedNo customer loyalty soughtDispassionate, professional, but not really friendlyStaff seemed tired and overworked at counters.As a Gold exec member I was mortified to find out that as a Gold member we were not allowed to choose a seat or exit seatAlso finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with Avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the leagueHow sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choiceFood still a letdown Chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggyBreakfast scrambled eggs and steak! Spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedibleHowever, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA\xe2\x80\x99s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a \xe2\x80\x9crandom\xe2\x80\x9d security hold by airport authoritiesbut that it could not be changed because of the websiteOnly after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA\xe2\x80\x99s controlUpon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) butFinally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage \xe2\x80\x93 adding salt to woundFinally, I called the UK "Customer Relations" center from Toronto, but I gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutesThey are incompetent and unhelpful in that field tooI wish I could give this rotten airline 0/10, but the minimum is 1/10 and I am happy with that.After many horrible experiences on BA, I am convinced this airline has total contempt not only for its customers but even for top tier elite frequent flyersI am AA Executive Platinum and I am being treated worse than cattle - forced to check in carry-on bag which is within the BA limits on multiple occasions, deniedboarding, zero upgrade policy, zero flexibility when being forcefully re-booked (recently I had to pay \xc2\xa3300 in addition to an already expensive \xc2\xa3400 ticket for a 2 hr EU flight)I will avoid British Airways even if it means an extra connection, flying a low cost carrier or not flying at all.The charge to reserve your seat is extortionate The check in staff at Gatwick were miserable to the point of rudenessThe inflight meal was appalling, and the pre arrival meal/snack was a jokeNo wonder British Airways are slipping down the ratings lists.My last two flights on British Airways have been a nightmareThe first flight, BA informed me at the airport I no longer had a ticket, as they had oversold the flightI avoided them for months after that oneThen I slipped back into a bad habit and booked them again for a work trip to UkraineI said no thank you, as my BA connecting flight was delayed by the same amountThey ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought I would not make it\'Sorry sir, the plane is now closed\'\'I wouldn\'t debate the point sir, a lot of people have been pushed off flights today, and hotels in London are being booked out, if I were you I wouldBecause of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in London (BA cover rooms up to \xc2\xa3200, fine, though if you have kids they give youGuess what, I am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given awayAgain, of course, its my problemBut all in super surly tone, and it was clear this was all my faultAbsolutely disgusting attitudeIts a shame, as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notchA team that is utterly let down by corporate, with their weak organisation and poor customer care policiesSo I would love to fly BA for the crew and pilots, but given their utterly terrible customer care, its just not worth it.I think some people expect too much on aircraft, airlines are cutting backNot sure what will happen when British Airways start to charge for food and drinks on European flights from January, not sure this will be a good move.are negatives in the fees and credit card booking fee that BA charge which I hate! Additionally I see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for foodI haven\'t flown British Airways for around 10 years, and with work I usually fly either middle-eastern or Asian airlines, what a contrast! I doubt BA have changed anything inThe TV screen is just 6in low resolution with a very small number of ok films available, nothing of interest with the music eitherSeats are so narrow - I paid extra for the emergency seat ($85!) after reading how narrow the seats were, a wise decision, but I shouldn\'t be paying extra asall middle-east and Asian airlines I have flown have bigger seats, better food choice, better entertainment - how can they offer such a poor service?Arm rest does not fully go up and I had an empty seat next to meFood was miserable - especially the dinnerLeg room was terrible and minimal for an aisle seat and crampedInflight entertainment was a bore - too little adult music like rock / country / jazzSome staff were very polite and pleasant while 2 or 3 were grumpy and seemed to not want to be working and dragging their feetThe tray table didn\'t work in fact broken, and the screen was dirty, the colour was goingWhite wine was warm, starter was a strange red cabbage in mayonnaise, dreadfulThe staff then disappearedThe trays weren\'t then cleared for an hourThey had lost a grip of the serviceThe breakfast was English, better than dinner, but no bread just awful Danish pastryPoor, thinking of what premium economy costs.DisappointedNo choice of meals (only veg or non veg) and the quality and quantity was extremely poorThey don\'t even contain any saladWas informed by the steward that only veg meals left and the meal was just dumped without even bothering to ask us, if we would like to have itNot that it mattered because the meals are not at all goodTo top it all, my luggage did not arrive on return to Washington DC.British Airways was known to be a quality airline but that does not apply any longerMy first bad experience earlier this year was to be told that my seat has been sold and they could not take me onboardI had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so I could wait having aBut this 10th December was just not acceptable, and my last trip with themTheir first plane was late by two hoursBy the time we arrived into London I had lost my connecting flightTheir behaviour is one of a cheap airline that cannot be relied on and in case of delay does not help you to get to your destination.We paid for the premium economy upgrade and the Flight Attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because the people behind us were complainingIn fact the one time the British airways rep told me to falsify a travel insurance claim to get my money back.Overall British Airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experienceFood was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china; no flair and was unimaginative at bestCrew on both flights were fairly mediocre - just went through the motions but didn\'t seem particularly interested in passenger service at all.The second meal on LHR-BOM was the worstLounge at LHR was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection- sad display for their main hubOverall I would not fly on BA by choice given their mediocre productProfoundly uncomfortable when fully flat as there is a hard bulge at the hinge, best sleeping position is with head elevated a few inchesFootstool that makes up lower part of flat bed came unhooked and dropped to the floor four times on preceding flightRestrooms a bit cramped compared to Airbus 330My upgrade was heavily discounted and I would never pay full price for Club World.Service is good but unexceptional, professional but no pamper, as is BAMy outbound transfer flight BA1389 was delayed by over 3 hours (schedule 09:55, actual 13:10)At Manchester airport, the BA service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customersAfter a 2 hour queue, they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service deskThis delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to ShanghaiMy flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 (Schedule 11:05, actual 14:06)After a 1 hour wait in the queue, the BA service personnel were not only unhelpful, but were extremely rude and aggressive towards meThey refused to help me book another flight to Shanghai, they refused to book me on a flight back to Manchester, they refused to help me retrieve my luggage, theyrefused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the \xc2\xa31814.60 air fareI explained that I was now stranded in Heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage, but they simply told me to leave the terminalas they would not be helping me any furtherAt no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that I was I was left outside Terminal 5 with no transport, no accommodation and no luggageI am a regular Skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews BA\'s regular tourist-class service has latterly received in this forum (haven\'t flown it myself in a couple ofHow they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery, with the onboard product being simply awful - and this on a newer Boeing 787 plane! The cabin wastatty - tables loose, problems with seat recline mechanism, IFE clunky and slowThe food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money savingAmenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and whilst the flight was quite empty in business, the service seemedStaff (when they appeared in the cabin) were quite friendly, but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that BA now provideService was casual to the point of "we don\'t really care"Seat became uncomfortable in the last 3 or 4 hours of the flight.Unfortunately delayed again for the same time as the duration of the flight, due to gate unavailabilityShort hop of just 35mins in the air unfortunately delayed by about the same amount of time due to someone not boardingI have been a loyal BA frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well changeOn my recent long haul flight to Nairobi from London, I was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available forfree - like some cut-rate budget short haul airline, you have to payHowever, unlike a budget airline, BA fares remain higher than mostliterally 1 muffin only - no juice, no fruit, no nothingIt is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have, as I have always done, accepted the higher fares for better serviceEven the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regimeIt is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been freeNote that BA never cut fares when the price of oil halved, making the current cutbacks about pure avariceDisrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formulaAnd I wouldn\'t blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treatedThe final insult was the response I got when I tweeted my above complaintsWhich as is apparent to all, a complete lie and insult to injuryI am flying again next week LON - NYC and hope, not optimistically, for better.The British Airways Lounge at Seattle is very poor for starters, with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression it\'s still the 1990\'sSingapore to London on the A380 was tight and IFE boxes under the seats severely restricts leg roomIn economy no amenity packs, no snacks on the 13hr flight and limited drink servicesDinner was served 1.5hr after take off and was pretty gross then breakfast was served 2 hr prior to landingWas very disappointed on all 6 flights that the cabin crew were not very friendly or helpfulFood was good, but like other reviewers we\'ve noticed little changes which make things not quite so specialFor instance, the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be, and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or whiteWe were given food from business, but it was served on a freezing cold plate, and just lacked finesseThe breakfast before landing at Heathrow was horrible, a bagel, with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal barsI must write and complain to BA about their breakfasts, and have done so once, with no effectDon\'t do itHere are the key reasons why you should not fly with British AirwaysFrom my experience I believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flyingThey hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customersEntertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your armNo phone charger and no USB portNo WifiSeats are very old, very uncomfortableSeat comfort was almost non-existent with appalling ergonomicsThe in-flight service hit a new low for me: absolutely shambolic, no team effort, aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengersFood and drink were cut-price and worsened by late wine and breadNo water offered and meal items forgottenEntertainment choices were sub-parShame on you British AirwaysIt was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entailMy other half who is 6\'3" was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90% of the flightThe small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfortAs a shorter limbed person at 5\'4", I was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flightPlaced in the middle, I barely had any where to put myself, seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was ofMy headphone socket was crackling and the film I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time) wasn\'t working, it was just a blackOn BA we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drinkOn this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellersWould much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with BA long haul ever again.Lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminalSeats onboard A321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom / seat pitchBA has become a very expensive and disappointing way to fly.Absolute disgraceThey cancelled my flight 1 hour and 45 minutes before the the flight and put me on the next flight with 3 hours 15 minutes delayI do have VIP access to the lounges, however, non of the lounges in T5 accepts my lounge access card/companyWhen I asked the BA staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting \xc2\xa35 worth of voucherSurely they can do better than thatIt probably doesn\'t mean anything to BA, but I am not a happy customer.\r\nMy 10 month old son could not fit in itThe only option was a child seat, however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seatCouple that with the need to breast feed your child, with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat, either his head would get banged on the armrestIt was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from London to Hong KongImagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can\'t fit in the seatTo travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and British airways refuse to do anything about it.I had a rude shock when I was told I had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alrightThey were tested when we had an ill passenger upon taxiing for departureFlight back was not as good as was delayed due to fog earlier in the day, check in was surly but on board crew still fineFare was cheap too, the only disappointment being that they don\'t have business class on domestic flights so we couldn\'t treat ourselves to a bit of luxuryI understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the 787, on a long daytime flight you can\'t cut out the sunshine,Seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over someone or have someone climbing over youNot up to standardThe lounge in Chennai was also poor.The lounge at Marrakesh is a joke with only a few seats and very limited choice of drinks - 2 miniature bottles of wine between approx 20 passengersMy only other issue would be my baggage was marked with priority but was one of the last to come off.It was a horrible experience while coming back from Sydney to Singapore on British AirwaysOur baby stroller was marked for some other airline en route to France, so we now have to wait long way if it will finally come back to SingaporeEven the refreshment meal was provided with the leftovers bread which was hard to eatThe cabin temperature was very low and worsened during our 8 hrs journeyI pledge not to take British airways ever.But they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd evenThey even hijack you for an additional $1000They have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customersSecond, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times I flew BA in first I had young attendants who clearly were not useA request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperienceNow please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? Clearly if they do not have enough formix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few penniesTheir menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two BA first class flights to the US when I wanted to try these snacks they were goneThe food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of US airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheatedWay to go BA, you have sunk to the lowest common denominatorThird, when I arrive in SF and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end ofthe delivery so they have failed on even that countUnlike the first class asian carriers like Singapore and Cathay where my FC luggage arrives first, BA is always hit and mostly missFinally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my FC experience on BAWhile business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a jokeIt was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flightCrumbs on the seatIn general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the IFE and some smaller details (e.gcarpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved)Lounge in LHR very outdatedBoarding in LHR was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don\'t listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other personsBut my impression is that quality is going down, e.gbeef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcookedClub Kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of BA is a joke nowadaysSelection seems to go down every time I flyWorst of all: One of my bags did not made it to the aircraftThis itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real jokeI explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that I did not checked another bag -> although I had my tag that I could showManager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional helpNo apologies for inconvience at allLast year I had one bag that was delayedExtremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvienceWhile in the past British Airways was really good it seems to decline from month to monthThis time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BAI can\'t any longer recommend BA as especially the value for money is no longer given.\r\n\r\nI thought Air India was the worst until I traveled by British Airways via Premium Economy Prices are not at all comparable thus I assumed they must be charging more for nicer services but not allBritish Airways staff at Delhi Airport were rude and unprofessionalComing to the aircraft, food and staff - equally poorFood was horrific, seats were torn, headphone socket not working, food tray was broken (I was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs) ,tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratchesStaff was not able to help at allNightmare experience.Baggage allowance is a jokeDoesn\'t matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staffThese items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable spaceOther flyers had their duty free items smashed and brokenWhen contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flightAbsolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airlineWe will certainly never be using BA again.Return check in again quick although the security system at BHD is slow very slowFlight time on the return a little longer 1hr 40 min due to congestion at LHRbut have to pay a \xc2\xa3150 fee\', and nothing else a little steep but OKBA make you pay to book a specific seat nowindicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto whatoption it would not be possible to take payment by VisaBy now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforceThey do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone, will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on theirMy return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff tooNever again.What we received was a polarisation of this - we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitchHaving flown long haul with BA on numerous occasions in the past I am completely shocked at the service we received - it was more like a budget airline -This is not the type of service I expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded World Traveller Plus cabinno drinks left apart from whisky or red wine - which neither one of us drinkAs the flight wasn\'t full I cant believe there would be a problem you just don\'t expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade thatthe service aboard a flight of more than eight hours - certainly not what I would expect from an airline such as BAsame poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissantI was looking to book a long haul holiday to the Maldives next year with BA but after this flight and the appalling customer service I received when I complainedcertainly don\'t think that justifies \xc2\xa3350 upgrade feeBA have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday I am not alone in making this decision and therefore I have booked my holiday nextBA can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need toIf that is the case, they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are gettingSeat comfort okay for 3-hours but would not have liked any longerStaff service completely forgettable from the outset - they really weren\'t making the effortMinimal communication and 2 rushed services at the start and end of the flightFood is a joke - a very small sandwich for a 3-hour flight it honestly can\'t get any lower (or can it?) Flight kept to schedule - ticket was quiteHaving flown BA for many years in all classes from first to economy, I could not believe how everything has declined so drasticallyThere was a choice of 2 meals, a pasta and sausages and mash, by the time it got to me there was only one meal on offer, I was refusedThe earphones for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my earsThe return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bunMr Cruz should realise that he is running a once proud national airline not Vueling, BA as our national airline is a total embarrassment.Outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped (centre seats), food not great and entertainment options poor but great bed made up for thisYesterday\'s flight on A380 also disappointing but seats much better (centre seats)Food quality very poorI returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potato/cheese thing uncookedThe breakfast muesli was horrible and the French toast was inedibleThe wine didn\'t seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a cartonWill not travel BA first againFelt very rushed in the morning with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and get dressed.However cabin interior is awful, seats are cramped and uncomfortableOn board service quality has declined on BA flights and this flight was not exceptionOffered food was only a sandwich (compared to hot meal recently) - it\'s a jokeEconomy Class complimentary service will end soonOur luggage was delayed 45 mins at Heathrow Terminal 5BA now offering low-cost airline standard - the only difference is price, it\'s more expensive which makes poor value for moneyI\'m still using BA regularly and I can see the obvious downgrade in standards during the last 2-3 years and even more dramatic decline in 2016Shame on British Airways for sliding down to so cheap and so poor image!For whatever reason RBI cancelled one of the flights, and it was only by accident that I found this out, by going on the BA websiteI had to change a flight and waste a day in BruneiBA have refused all responsibility, even on the lack of communicating the cancelled flight to meI find this deplorable after booking everything through BAI would certainly never book anything direct with BA again, as this lack of service by a major carrier to a customer is despicable.The space provided for business class seats on this flight is just ludicrousFor the price paid for these tickets versus the value received this is daylight robberytrying to figure out why I cannot get on the airplaneSo, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong!? My name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my US Permanent Resident Card does not match with my passportmy US Permanent Resident Card and stop me at the gate like that?! So, when she asked me if I have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my lastname, I jokingly answered \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage certificate??\xe2\x80\x9d Next thing I know was I cannot get on the airplane because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have marriage certificate with me, and what made it evenbeyond ridiculous!Very bad flight, when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick upLong time BA customer but do not know if I will fly again.Recently flew a return trip with BA to Miami onboard one of their A380 aircraft, and what has happened to this airline! Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we hadboarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaroundFrom the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it wasThis went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was "normal" on all their A380 aircraftThe food was horrid and only a choice of 2 mealsI chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasyThe return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrivalThe food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the "breakfast" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob ofI\'m certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn\'t be issued with ear plugsIt is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seatsThe food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was goodNobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinksAll sloppyThe 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747sVery little wow factorThey ran out of Cod - and at this point I don\'t think we had hit the cruiseMy wife\'s allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flightAnother underwhelming experience with BAThe flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at DubaiThe situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departureApparently minimum rest period had been compromisedMine was starting to show signs of wearLamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastlyHorrible in factThe apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricotAll dry and tastelessThe food is very poor on quality compared to other airlines covering the same route, only two offerings of water on the outbound flightUsually fly this route in business class and British Airways offering is far inferior product on this route alsoThis was one bad trip too many with British Airways.I paid an additional fee for my seat but irrespective, felt "packed in"The seat was very uncomfortable, slow service from section cabin staff and  in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraftChaotic boarding did not help mattersInitially late boarding as aircraft was late on stand so cleaning could\'ve been betterThe inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experienceThe benefits were notFirstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad moodA lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisanceHow sillyHere the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto)So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a \'choice\' of one red wine, and plastic cutleryWhatever, it was awfulWhat a waste of resourcesThe Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toiletswas! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip onIs nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential? On arrival in UK we read that BA is to put evenGoodbye British Airways - not even nice to have used you.British Airways service keeps on getting worse and worseI will only fly getting worse and worse if they are cheaper than all the competition, which they almost never are.Nice crew but slightly inexperienced and not totally familiar with aircraft typeMain meal was very averageScallops overcooked and main beef part overcooked on one sidePower outlets wouldn\'t work with my iPhone or iPadLarnaca to London Heathrow, and wow, British Airways has gone downhillVery grumpy and abrupt staff and the meal, if you can call it that, was a sandwich and a small coffee in a paper cupThe flight was cancelled with no reason for 24 hoursNo apologies, a text message sent to my phone 4 hours before departure with no telephone or contact numberIf you deal with BA this will be where you call for everything - cut off three times and completely incoherentThe plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable, it was in a dire stateOn arrival to my "Club World" bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhereI handed it to a stewardess who said "that bit isn\'t important" whilst looking down at me and taking it awayThe inflight system was a joke, the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anythingAll the pixels were brokenThe charging for laptops etc was US only and the remote for the entertainment system didn\'t workAn announcement came on before we left "we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergyPlease do not eat any nuts at anytime"Once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut! I am proud to be British, but I am incredibly embarrassed for BritishAirways to represent my country in such a poor wayTrust me, they are nothing short of a joke.Turned up at St Lucia to be told British Airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded : this is on a \xc2\xa31700 ticketAccording to the duty manager, they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengersBreakfast was a croissant which had come out of a fridge, and was disgusting.It is reliable and safe but the attitude of the cabin staff put me offWe departed more or less on time and got to London on time but had to do one circuit because of trafficI was booked on Air Canada but rebooked onto British Airways as I was unable to make the AC flight since AC cancelled an earlier flight from YYJ to YVRHaving flown British Airways in the past, I was looking forward to flying them again, but my trip was somewhat disappointingCabin crew seemed approachable, but after the meal service, cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to LondonI wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button - then waited over 15 minutes until a cabin crew walked byIt is very evident that BA\'s service standard has slipped considerably since I last flew with them in 2013The only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flightIt worked fine on the return journey and I guess it\'s just one of those things, just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored.Silver card holder with British Airways and PPS card with Singapore - Singapore to London leg - average - when called for service staff had a bit of an attitudelike it wasn\'t their job so doesn\'t do BA any favours1.5 hours late and they sent the baggage to the wrong part of the airport so 45 mins delay at the baggage areaBarcelona flight averageWorst bit - BA codeshareBA have not got their act together on codeshare at all- as silver card holder booking BA I had zero BA rights - tried to charge me for second bagGet to the lounge BA have explicitly asked for Vueling codeshare to be excluded so no ability to use loungeBecause the Vueling flight was third leg none of the check in online to Singapore on BA leg worked so I had to go to the BA desk to getchose SQ /Star alliance - your LST couple of years focus on cost control and being cheap and not sorting out a codeshare process for both standards and your poorIT interaction that doesn\'t treat me as a cardholder and works just put me in the- "will fly SQ next time I come to Europe" bracketYou can cost cut yourself out of business.That\'s why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn\'t face being crammed into a microscopic economy seatWhat a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow\'s Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signsI made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline\'s loungeThe place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the roomIt was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroomThe whole point of spending \xc2\xa3385 was legroom and I didn\'t have anyIn that case don\'t make the same mistake as meI cannot believe that British Airways want to embarrass flight staff so much, as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served, which we were neverIt is so sad for loyal customers, if we wanted to go on Easyjet or Ryanair, we would, but to receive the same treatment is a great shame.Extremely chaotic check in at MLA, with no British Airways staff checking who is queuing where resulting in premium lane being filled with non C class / FF membersdo something about thisAnnoying passengers as per usual when using LGW - for me that\'s a holiday airport with people who don\'t fly often yet they claim to be the Alfa and omegaof flying (to the point that we were told off by people behind us for reclining our seats and I quote "obviously you don\'t fly much" - us being silverLanded ahead of schedule but ended up waiting for bags until all were offloaded despite having a priority tag on themCrew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so I never got a welcome drinkThe food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognitionAs always BA\'s lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing (the Club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems)The inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hallPre-landing snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing aboutCrew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servingsIf I had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price I would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product providedBritish Airways needs to step up their game to get my money again.Another less than satisfactory experience with British AirwaysPlane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slotThe BA airport crew didn\'t care and given the management at BA don\'t care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of ChickenWe got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoyingThe seats? Well the usual abysmal so called "Club Europe." A disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a saleThey get very embarrassed about talking about BA cutbacksNot holding my breath that it is going to be an eye popping experience.Had pre-booked seat 14k and, on taking seat, noticed rubbish piled at back of seat, empty plastic bottles and paper etcOverall the cabin appeared dated and untidyAlso the in-flight entertainment screen did not workA complete fiasco ensued highlighting the ineptitude of British Airways staffBA motto "to fly to serve" - I Think not.Tokyo Haneda to London, and British Airways is cost cutting all the time! I was extremely disappointed with the onboard cateringFor a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or foodThe tuck box vanished from your offeringPretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed It looks like despite BA\'s good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levelshow he feels at the end of it! Maybe he will turn a little skinnier! Certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience!I slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had noThe only reason I fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and I dislike the club seating arrangementA previous review complained that on the 787 there is only one toilet in first but there are only 8 seatsNo sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gateCabin crew looked uninterested during boardingAt 9:30pm meal arrived, no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners mealsI got a bread roll she didn\'t, she got a dessert I didn\'t, neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty I had the cheekto ask a member of cabin crew for a Diet Coke! Woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted itThe final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long I had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaningI\'m ashamed British Airways is my national carrier.11 hour flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco on a very very tired looking Boeing 777-200 was not what I had expectedCouldn\'t sit with my partner as unlike most "leading carriers", BA opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens? When checkNever again British Airways, never again!After many years of flying on BA, being a gold member for the last 6 years, I have finally lost my patience with BAThere is no point BA even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customerwhen things go wrongThe plane was a fairly new A380 and on the outbound journey, the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properlyOn the Inbound a few days later, we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entireThe ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toiletsIt meant no running water to flush the toilet (although the suction system still worked), and not running taps to clean ourselves, and of course no tea of coffee facilitiesTo top things off, after landing back to LHR, the ground crew from BA forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in thebags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 minSo in summary, I get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound, which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft, and toiletissues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to15,000 Avios Points! What\xe2\x80\x99s 15,000 going to get me? Surely I ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone (who seems embarrassed herself having to tellme) couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anymore as the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s decision is finalanswer was no, they don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to anyone.Yet another abysmal flight from BANo wonder the majority of passangers flying short haul these days are on package toursThe decision to issue hand luggage only tickets is a poor oneOn this flight, I witnessed several arguments over locker spaceMeal service costed of a barely edible sandwich hastily delivered with no finesseDo BA executives never sample their economy short haul product?Very poor serviceCould not book a massage in their lounge despite trying to book 3 weeks in advanceThe cabana in their lounge was smelly and had no clear partition from the toilet/ showerNobody bothered to check if I needed anything.Priority boarding was a jokeOutbound service on board was mediocreCabin crew slow to anticipate passengers\' needsNo WifiFood OK but not greatOn arrival I asked the chief stewardess about fast track only to be brushed off with "we don\'t do fast track here"Return flight was equally poorRang the bell and no one cameYet another abysmal flight with BAThe majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groupsThe cheaper no checked baggage tickets, allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage, cause chaos on boarding, with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into theConsequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take placeAll semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned, there is no welcome on board, only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enoughThe seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortableCabin so called service, was nonexistantThings started off poorly at checkin when BA\'s computer system went down  a seemingly constant problem ) It wasn\'t long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she\'s seenBA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you\'re asleepHere\'s where BA\'s systems again breaks down and their computer isn\'t working to locate the bag in the hullWe land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes inNo, can\'t do that and you\'ll have to apply for a refundMeanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I was told later that that is "promotional" and to hell with a paying passengerThe bottom line is, don\'t fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligibleAlthough a better flight than two weeks ago the \'service\' of a small packet of crisps, peanuts or biscuit is a disgracePassengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offeringFor our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of \'To fly-to serve\'We will choose any other airline over British Airways in future - human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the BA management (although the cabin staff did their very best)Truly shocking values and not customer focussed in any way whatsoever.Appalling airlineThe booking process is dreadful - they charge if you want to change seat in economy, I have been told they will be charging for food and drink from January,and the website very difficult to useTheir customer "service" via phone or email is abysmal (they are extremely rude, give completely wrong information, and I have been cut off, given wrong numbers and put through toWhilst some of the cabin staff are lovely, many are extremely unhelpfulThis week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker (the bag was not oversized, but I have a bad back at present, andI asked him very politely) - yet he outright refused though he helped other peopleI flew Club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scatteredWhich he did, but with very bad graceAnd every single time I do fly with them, I am reminded why I dislike them so much.I know that BA has refurbished some of their B747-400 and B777 but the rest are a disgracebeing passive-aggressive), but this is a humourless serviceThe in-flight catering is lack-lustreI choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awfulFirstly, smarten up the staff (have you seen the LAN uniforms?)The IFS systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old BBC sitcoms/ soaps offeredthat spread out - leads to some people not hearing being calledI could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying "I have called them and they are not listening so I am not doing it anymore"I really think it is not nice, given the distance between the counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal.I am only sorry we had to take a bus in Lisbon to get to the terminal.Have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin serviceI absolutely agree, and what a shamePerhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance? On long transatlantic flights, cabin stewards disappear for at least 4-5 hours mid flightWe frequently use British Airways morning flight from Boston to London, and will again, but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startlingBeware, however, Fast Track security at Heathrow, which twice in the last six months, has been glacial, no better than regular lines.The choice of seats (free of charge) was very poor, even the plane was half-fullThe check-in (baggage) organization in JFK was a messLong lines with no priority for members The staff in the plane more less accabtableMy hand luggage got misplaced in the plane, I think somebody just remove itRecommendation to BA, staff behaved partly unacceptableI never in my life had a flight as bad as this oneThe staff were rude and inattentiveI pressed the flight attendant button so many times, and after waiting 20 mins, they just switched it offHowever, that was not the worst of it - the flight was so coldWe asked if they could please turn it up (they didn\'t care), multiple passengers asked for extra blankets (not that it would help)I will never fly direct to Mauritius with British AirwaysI paid more for a direct ticket, than a indirect flight, but thanks BA for letting me realise paying more doesn\'t equate to better service.What a mistake to choose BA for this business class flightThe experience of the seats (with their weird coffin-like configuration, sliding screens, and people climbing over me almost continually) was enough to say "never again"The service was very patchy, with some decidedly long-faced and size-challenged cabin staffCoffee undrinkable, and forget having a choiceThis simply comes nowhere close to Thai, Emirates or CathayShame about the flight and the quite hideous seating: tight, face to face with a complete stranger, noisy and hard.So clear evidence of passenger inequality at BA, even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin classFirstly, why do I, who flies several times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to "choose" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choiceof 12 seats to choose from? Secondly, why do BA offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can chooseBut BA appear to suffer from some kind of \'seat hoarding\' issue for some reasonI presume they would rather people pay the \xc2\xa315 to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets, something I personally will neverThis is not as good as the Etihad First which has a central aisle with individual cabins (called apartments) of the aisleI have never flown BA before but have heard not so good reports, so was a bit apprehensiveDriving up the 101 to SFO had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congestedMy only one gripe with BA is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in PremiumNight before travel, I was unable to select a seat during on-line check-in, so next day I proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat was available dueMid-flight snack box was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizzaCabin crew were OK and nothing exceptional on both sectorsWhen fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggleThere was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor qualityThe food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup)Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tiredThe lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortablyThe bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they getThe flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business classGiven the choice I would not fly BA again.My husband and I flew from Atlanta to London and it was a nightmare experienceFirst the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in London to go to Geneva, we only had 45 minutes do so andit was a nightmareNo one to helped us, we had to run like crazy in the airportI was shocked that British Airways did not provide us with any assistance, obviously they do not care about their customersOn our way back, the flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40 minutes, and we had to run again in order to catch our flight toWe flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom, when you are in premium economy, there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and itThe food is non existent, one ounce of salad and four once of a "so-called" meal + dessert and watery coffeeYou will be left hungry, so don\'t rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointmentWe paid $3800 for this trip and I regret choosing this airlinePremium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but that\'s itYou will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economyI will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a hugeairport and British Airways flights are lateAirways was offNot worth the price nor the headache.We flew from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta to London Heathrow on September 2nd, and I have to say it was the worst experience I have had flyingAs uncomfortable as it was I said I would try get some sleep, when I opened the blanket there were long black hairs stuck to itThe seats were ripped tooWhen the meals came out I didn\'t get offered one, 2 hours into the flight I asked the lady for a mineralI am still waiting!They do have a stuffiness and it irritates that we need to pay for selecting any seats, even if we fly Business classThis is something that I and every sensible person, would consider as utter madnessBoarding was chaotic although this is nothing to do with BA but its the airport messReturn leg was not full, seat upstairs and it seemed quieterfeature and is annoyingThis crew seemed to be in a race to complete the dinner service - again chicken and rice (5 days after outward trip) and not as well preparedCabin crew seemed younger than usual and maybe they needed a senior to point out to them that hurrying the serving of meals is too obvious and not what weProbably one of the worst flight/travel experiences me and my family have had to endure! From what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family takingFirst when checking in in Abu Dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new Boeing 787Of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communicationPassengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on, eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 amThe actual flight time was 14:00, then the plane was delayed yet againBritish Airways staff were no where to be found! Eventually a supposed British Airways manager arrivedWe then couldn\'t check in because the system was broken, after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled inUni.! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffedThen on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for Uni was missing, apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it isAgain no communication from British Airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre personSad thing is that in the move to Uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag, when we explained this to the BA phone operator,she was told that was probably not the wisest decisionNow sitting on the plane returning to home to Abu Dhabi (same plane) 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engineGreat you found the leak! But a new plane all these problems! Seriously British Airways, should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world.\r\nAircraft in poor state of preparation with stains on back of seat leather and generally dirtyPushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle40 minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that lead to CSD threatening to return aircraft to stand with oneVery noisy group of males on golf holiday in seats to rear of row 21 who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language - spoken toThe food just gets worse each trip I fly with them - muesli high in sugars and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard - is this really the best theycan do? Finally to round off flight, a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flights I have ever taken with BACabin staff great but product is poor.These, and a drink in a small plastic cup were served with no finesse; possibly the cabin crew were embarrassed by the lack of anything more substantialBritish Airways need to decide whether to improve food offered on short haul flights, or to have reasonably priced good quality snack available as do their low cost competitors.Poor boarding procedure at T5 with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on, passing others who were waiting andseemingly not sure whether to board or notSat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about 3 hours of taking offCabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures, saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengersTravelling with 3 children who didn\'t like the only option offered, so much frustration with British Airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service priceComplained to Customer Service after arriving home and was told the caterer at LHR was to blame and they didn\'t want to delay the flight waiting for the extra mealsSeems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew saidHard to recommend BA but given the competition on this route, and the desire to stay with One World/BA FFP, it\'s a poor choice.It seems British Airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that it\'s turning into a budget airline at scheduled pricesGround staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths, refusing to change my seat because "that\'s what the computer has allocated"Boarding was the now expected shamblesThe no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premiumOn this flight several were removed from lockers, and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front, thus severely restricting leg roomCabin staff were rude and uncaringBritish Airways flight BA632 from LHR to Athens on 11th September was by far the worst cabin crew that I have encountered in 45 years of flyingAfter that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedibleNo top up of drinks no offer of water, and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talkingI even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft, and received no replyBritish Airways migrating to southern terminal and it causes a chaosAnd when 5 flights are delayed, there is no capacity even for business class passengersDoes BA ground staff care about it? The "computer says no" attitude prevails together with the usual BA familiarity and "sorry" that means nothingTry to be more professional and show some respectNow the customer service is non existent and no one cares about anythingCheck in on the return again quick as was the priority security lane otherwise Istanbul Ataturk airport is not my favourite its crowded & dirty, the lounge used by BAis one of the worst! Not worth the trouble of findingalthough the flight arrived on to the furthest possible gate and immigration (Not BA\'s fault) took so long with huge queue which meant over 1 hour getting landsideSo disappointed with BAReally useless airlineFlight delayed on arrival to London 3 hours and no reason givenMissed connecting flight to Perth from SingaporeWas given Pay-in lounge access and this was better than nothing but I wonder why they couldn\'t have just given me access to their loungePay to reserve seats? Pay to request meal? I guess BA is positioning itself as a budget airline, but its price doesn\'t reflect that yetIt\'s a shame as I enjoy the transit through Singapore rather than the gulf statesThe crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seatsThe meal was dry and of poor qualityThe cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served, it was cold andWhen the crew member made my bed up I was informed they had "run out" of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after I complained about thepoor experience to the CSMBased on this experience, BA\'s penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for First ClassI would like to know who at British Airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in Club (I know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but Ijourney was just about passable but not comfortable given the seatingThe flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers wereso fed upwith sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpitsOnce at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete dramabut I won\'t go there on this ocassion)So - what did we get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little, and what we did get was rubbishIn fact choose another airline since BA on this route are just a jokeI have been Club Europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once Ihave used up my 300K Avios it\'ll be Bye Bye BA for goodBritish Airways have gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactoryNot only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways, but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight, I only just boarded the aircraft onOn both flights they ran out of one of the food options, leaving only the vegetarian dishThey onboard entertain system was low quality - a small screen with poor resolutionSeats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines I\'ve flown in economy, Their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowanceShows how far BA have fallen when they\'re being outdone by the Colombian national carrierBritish Airways is getting worseOnline check in, what\'s the point if you cannot choose seats?  No warm food on any of my recent flights (except Transatlantic), yet the prices still don\'t reflect thisAlways late when flying in or out of Gatwick, which might be due to the airport.I went into the British Airways app on my phone 20 seconds after online check-in opened, and totally disappointed to see only 4 seats available to choose fromThis is the second time this has happened with British Airways in the last few months, who really should not be offering an online check-in service if you not givenIf British Airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat, and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying, then they should abolishthe online check-in as it\'s clearly not providing the service it should do - Online check-in means being able to choose from several seats, not being unacceptably limited to 4The in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departingCabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay! No newspapers available, when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing BA couldSo called \'Brunch\' was served, which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato, lettuce leaf and cucumberVery poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flightThis to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how BA expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their ticketsCabin crew did nothing to stop economy passengers coming through to use the toilet in business, is it that difficult? Very poor show and think we will look at alternativesWent to BA to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so I needed to resolve it with my travel agentCheck in staff not bothered and bordered on being rudeLounge in Atlanta was mediocre at bestFlight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren\'t anything specialMy baggage didn\'t arrive at Heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with BA lost baggage - it was finally delivered almost a week laterOverall, not the kind of service that you would expect when flying First Classthat was due to land in Atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to Heathrow, their system "automatically took my booking off" - I don\'tknow whether this is normal but I\'ve never come across this issue before in all my years of flyingAbsolutely awful customer serviceBA have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isn\'t good enough, not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins, which is atrociousNeedless to say, won\'t be flying with them again if I can help it.On boarding disappointed by the cleanliness of the cabin, when lowering the tray table from the seat in front on both my seat 4C and my wife 4A, they werevery dirty, nothing that could not be solved by a wet cloth, but not good enoughFlight landed on time into Dubrovnik, but our bags were about the last through so priority clearly doesn\'t workA bit disappointing really.Very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for BA 31 service to HKG on September 10thFirst no explanation, then that they "could make a family happy to sit together", but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or notBut still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck- I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated meI am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the caseCommunication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits? Especially concerningtheir reservation policy, that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together! The flight itself was, asidePoor snacks on board despite comfortable and pleasant flightBA recently started this route some months ago with low cost flights but the service does not meet the standards that should be expected for a company with its dimensions.The many problems I had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my returnon the planet, BA cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal, T5Fast Track security was woefully slow and incompetentThough I had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service I had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items anddespite management\'s false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that "Our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of theThe flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offeringIn all a waste of money for BA\'s "vaulted" business class "experience." The recent Economist article about BA\'s race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made alongthe way speaks volumes about management\'s hostility towards customers and especially BA and OW elitesThe asterisk on the Oneworld baggage page singles out BA as the only carrier in the group who will not allow it\'s own elite fliers and those on OW toWhen I arrived to the gate 5 mins before closing the lady said that BA moved me to another flight because this flight was full and my previous plane delayedI asked if the company will compensate me for the cancellation because I will miss another connecting flight in MoscowShe said that the company will not compensate me anything because it is not the company\'s fault After what she said that I am not listening and she will cancel my next flight that BA transferred me to - BA 235I listened again, but could not understand few things stillWhy no one met me at the arrival if there was a risk of me being lateWhy at least she didn\'t say sorry even once and continued to insist on her version that it was not fault of the companyIs it really something that BA treats as a normal practice?The aircraft was very old with outdated TV screens, uncomfortable seats and an air conditioning system which settles dust on air ventsFood was ok, nothing exciting, but when breakfast was served it was started way too late so by the time the food was served, there was no time to serveWeb-check did not workQuite irritating, as this information could have been easily shown at the start of the procedureBA uses a shared lounge in VIE, which is on the poor side, rather small and cramped, with limited food optionsLounge experience in LGW was very unsatisfactoryWhy BA gives up its own lounge space in its hub airport to accommodate another airline is beyond meAs for business class, I have stopped using BA a while ago due to the condensed seating arrangements on both short haul and long haul flights.Let down by aircraftIFE was not working for the whole plane for the whole flightAn OK flight but the business offer is not worth the extra cost(Boarding on outbound and inbound flight chaotic with priority going to families with babies of which there were very very many).\r\n\r\nThe seats were a disappointment, they felt slightly harder and more narrow than the seats on older Emirates 777/A380, CX 777 or Lufthansa A380However, this is where the criticism endsI booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flightThe travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowanceI called BA and was messed around by their staff memberI had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to LondonAt Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strikeI joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jumpWhen other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuingBaggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bagsHowever, charges for baggage are outrageous and place BA in the same category as budget airlinesUnfortunately I could not have the meal as I do not eat anything with added sugarToilets - Only saw 2 toilets which was rather over used and busyReturn flight - Airplane was bit dirty\r\nI have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crewOver the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I\'m afraid it just can\'t compete anymore, it needn\'t be so as the issues as I see them areThere were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew "invisible", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauceWe were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be wokenOnce we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlockedWhen comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn\'t cut the mustard any longer I\'m afraidSuch as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra \xc2\xa3 for service and food that just isn\'t forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?The first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the systemAt check-in I spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junk-fee for a single piece of luggageAgain I had to call BA 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outboundThe third call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting BA\'s mistakesI spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk feeThe BA lounge at TXL is small and does not have a toiletThere were no warm food items on offerBA not only does not compete on price but amazingly, no longer competes on service.I fly the route regularly and I have noticed decline in the BA level of serviceBoarding in Warsaw is chaoticNew BA short haul seats are  not really comfortable (fine for 1h flight but get uncomfortable for any longer)Crisps and drinks with no possibility of buying further food is not enough for 2.5h flightThe WAW to LON route is served with other carriers (including budget ones) and I will have hard time justify paying a premium to fly BA on this route inThe British Airways experience has really declined over the past 5 yearsHowever the staff and service has declinedRarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs - they are on automatic pilotWe travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problemWith a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller- the only reason we got it (ground staff forgot) was because the older and verycaring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it! The younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waitingThe good in the lounge and on board has suffered as wellThe jack on the new style headphones didn\'t fit in the socket, so if I wanted to listen to anything I had to sit and hold the jack in placeThere was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customersA far cry from the scone, jam and cream of a couple of years ago - and even worse than the bruschetta, mini breadsticks, tomato salsa, packet of mixed nutsDon\'t even get me started on the disgusting muffin that has replaced the salmon and egg roll as the meal before landing on the outward journey! The toilets were notchecked as often as they should have been and I had to inform the cabin crew that there was no toilet roll leftVery disappointing.The outbound flight was delayed, (approx2.5 hours), which was very frustratingBoarding the flight was another hassle in so far as we were bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and then there was confusion around seating arrangements! Once we wereThe food was terrible, tomato and egg sandwich with other little tit bits! Return leg, was on time, but the check in queue was horrendous! The flight left on time,on board entertainment was a struggle as we did not have individual monitors, and we were offered tomato and egg sandwiches again as a meal5:30pm flight to arrive at 8:30pm but served only a pack of chips with a drink, not even a sandwich for this 2.5 hour flightThere is nothing to be purchased on BAI arrived at the airport within the permitted check-in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queueI went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleaguesBoarding was not efficientThe queue was poorly managedMy seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor My bag did not arrive into Dublin with me and so I had to join a queue for SwissportThis is where my nightmare startedA uniformed woman who said she represented BA told me my bag would \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely\xe2\x80\x9d not arrive until tomorrowOver the next few days a nightmare beganThe departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficultHowever the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller casesIf I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flightUnfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure oneThe Business Class Cabin on a British Airways A380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per rowIn the BA configuration, passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbedAlso, the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes, and the seats are claustrophobically narrowBy far the worst Business Class seats I\'ve ever encountered.\r\n\r\nI fly this route 3-4 times a year, unfortunately there is no competition other than Air CanadaI\'ve had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfiedI have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - I offered to send BA this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored theThe discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours - for which I did not blame the airline - meaning I spent 8As a result I arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would have brought food on the flight had I known of the miserly cost-cuttingI wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration, as this can\'t easily be remedied and willput me off using the airline againI ended my complaint saying I had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellersI\'ve just received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint, indicating that it was not evenread, and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economyUnfortunately due to renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn\'t as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I\'m sure thatThe only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclinedAircraft was filthy dirty with wires hanging downWhy do they fly such wrecks? Inbound Frankfurt - Heathrow on A319British Airways have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal tray Club Europe! The seats were narrow and uncomfortable economy seatsThe flight attendant was grumpy, rude, and sullenI accept this was a short flight, but how British Airways get away with calling this Business Class is beyond meI wonder if any BA senior executives bother to fly their so-called Premium Classes? \r\n\r\nIt would have been fine had I not paid top dollar for all the amenitiesI submitted a complaint and asked for a partial $$$ voucher but to no availThe customer service personnel told me things in conflict to documented conversationsBA told them they would not refund anything because it was a voluntary upgradeReally? BA changed my flight and rerouted me with less amenities What is so irrating is the cost was over $4,000 for each ticket and I was not provided the service or flight I paid forFalse advertising.Awful experienceMy baggage is delayed since Tuesday 2 August, they told me that my 2 pieces of lugagge were going to arrive the next dayI\xc2\xb4ve been waiting and nothing has been received yetI even paid for the upgrated seats to ensure a good care with my luggage will be given, however everything has been very dissapointingMy first experience with British Airways has been awful.BA denied me boarding because their system required not only me, but also the cello seat needs to have an ESTA visa! They were unable to distinguish between a passengerAfter 3 hours of stress at check-in they denied me boarding and quoted me over $4,000 to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journeyI am appalled my their total lack of customer service and will never fly with them again.Boarding for the outgoing flight (BA15) from Singapore was a bit disorganised and there was congestion on the aerobridgeOn board the aircraft had an air-conditioning problem so the cabin was quite warmPrior to arrival I received a snack box which contained a really bad sandwich, granola bar and some yoghurtCabin crew didn\'t offer a regular drinks service on this flightDisappointingly they did not have enough champagne on the return sector for anything other than a pre flight drinkThis being explained by broken windscreen on flight BA206 which led to their passengers being rebookedOur own flight BA208 was befallen by a damaged tyre which took 3 hours to fixToilets constantly used by economy class passengers which left them less clean than usual and less readily availableThey had to manage 300 missed transfers as a result of the delayed arrival and the staff seemed well prepared for thisBaggage damaged (one item) and lost (two items)The BA 747s are all in my experience quite tired lookingHowever I will be sad to see the back of them when the 777s arrive on this route in a couple of monthsThe First cabin looks nice but it doesn\'t feel like a First Class environmentThe food was at best ordinaryThe menu was not very inspiring, the main course was simply dreadful, dry chicken, the whole meal was not exciting as I would expect from a First Class dinner serviceInflight entertainment poorBA have great staff, but prices are very high across all cabins and I am sorry to say on this flight it was not worth it.However, slightly inferior cabin service, for example no hot towels, no drinks menu etcThe club world kitchen content was poor and inadequate, when I visited they had only ice cream on offerBaggage damaged on arrivalHowever, inferior in comparison to middle eastern airlines.The lounge in Athens was basic, and the furniture was very worn and needed replacementFast forward and the lounges are generally borrowed from other airlines that make you feel like a second class citzien, the planes are tired with worn out interiors and allof this is reflected in other passengers dissapointment in a generally lack lustre flying experienceBritish Airways ruined our holidayTherefore we missed our connecting flight and when we approached the BA customer service desk for help, the customer service advisor was disinterested, smug and extremely unhelpfulWe travelled from Aberdeen to Heathrow and on to San Francisco with no issues other than very poor legroomEven less legroom than on a local flight to Europe (Ryanair) on a 10 hour flightOn the return journey the first flight from San Francisco to Heathrow was delayedOnce on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had adiscrepancyVery scary in view of the security situationThen our row of 3 seats had no in-flight entertainment (row 28) The first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could notfix itSo we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainmentOn landing at Heathrow our next flight to Aberdeen was also delayed for one hourNot much use if you intend never to fly BA againShocking customer serviceIt was very strange to be bussed to the aircraft rather than using an airbridge, but this was due to capacity issuesAfter a wait of 30 minutes whilst a stream of economy passengers\' queries were dealt with, a rude and unhelpful agent checked me inI asked if the seat 2C, I had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no, I had been allocated seat 3C and the allocation could notI wonder if this was a ploy by BA to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delayCertainly not BA\'s finest hour.My complaint is about the service and rudeness of the British Airways boarding staffPriority boarding lane had over 50 people waiting while no one was in line for the general boardingWhen I tried to attract the attention of the attendant, he addressed me with such rudeness and disregardHis words were "you are not the only First class passenger" and kept ranting even after I left his stationThis is not acceptable in any situationI cannot believe this just happenedWill never set foot in another BA flight.Sadly British Airways Business Class, London Heathrow to Geneva is no longer worth any extra costI\'m only 185cm and can\'t sit comfortably and relax without being sidewaysIn addition to Chamonix we have homes in London and Telluride, Colorado and BA lost us as customers for quite a few years on the LHR to DEN, 777 service,again because of the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat configuration in Business Class, that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during theas BA Business was so baddo this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service.\r\nI did not choose BA for this flightBag drop agent surly and unhelpfulTerminal 3 lounge chaoticTables grubby and cluttered with dirty plates and glassesAt 10.00am in the morning the only food available was stale croissantsServers in the lounge unhelpful and reluctant to produce champagne when requestedBoarding process was the BA chaos I have come to expectWhy do BA gate staff show so much resentment towards premium passagersNew club seating is atrociousLate take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations, and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistanceSeat very uncomfortableWhere do BA recruit such useless staff, and are they specially trained to have no customer focus? BA is certainly not my airline of choice\r\nThe British Airways Club Europe (Business) product is dreadful value for moneyBoarding wasn\'t done by priority, just a free for all at the gate - fine but nothing specialMy real issue is with the offering on-board: no special seats, just the middle seat of three left freeJust not worth it on every level.I would suggest British Airways should not behave like a no frills airlines, your name and brand mean much more than those cheap airlinesSo please stop charging people extras when they have booked and paidI might be just one customer, but one customer\'s review can\'t be read by many.\r\nAbsolute appalling service received by British Airways, I had a morning flight from Amsterdam to London which they cancelled for fog, the flight was for 10am and even though theweather was clear by 9.30 am, they refused to book me on another flight until 10pm - not even a meal was offered to me all that timeI was in the airport from 7am till 9pm, that is for over 14 hours, and was told it was weather and out of their hands, even though they hadI was shocked by the treatment given the way I held the airline in high esteem, to the point that I have now refused to purchase any flight via themCannot believe how bad British Airways wasThey would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered whyThe flight was massively overbookedThere was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seatsThis is utterly irresponsibleVery few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancellingNot a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situationIt was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with itThey have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longerThey refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensationBritish Airways has lost my business forever.The outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hourFlying back in economy was an absolute nightmareEverything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggageThe check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to meI provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declinedNot surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding passShe didn\'t even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her systemshe didn\'t investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn\'t botherWrong name, Wrong flight etcThey asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have itAfter arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn\'t show upI explained the situation which she didn\'t really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arriveAgain, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.Connecting from Heathrow to Amsterdam was a disasterThey board passagers onto the plane just for them to later find out that the plane was defectThe pilot and engineers tried fixing the problem and let us sit inside for 3 hoursFinally discovered that they couldn\'t fix it, took another 30 min to let us back out to the terminal for us to find solutions ourselvesNo food after 7 hours of searching for a flight to AmsterdamGot to Amsterdam and my luggage had never been loaded onto the plane.Inbound was similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at LHR for 40 minutes which spoilt a little the endingA delayed flight was made worse when the pilot assured us that arrangements were being made for our connecting flightThe reality was standing in a line for 6 hours, causing us to miss flights with other airlinesI will not fly British Airways again.Absolutely terrible serviceFlight delayed four hoursCheck-in staff rude and arrogant and didn\'t explain the delayPlane was not that cleanFor the money they charge you can get better service elsewhereBoarding was not well organizedOur flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure timeOne BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect informationWe waited another 25 minutes for busesFood was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rockComing home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good valueOur flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from RomeBoarding was chaotic and you couldn\'t understand the announcements being made about who was to board and whenOther people were turned back rather rudely by BA staffEveryone seemed confusedThen we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take offService was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of youOur luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in LondonOn the downside, very small TV screen on the back of the seatsThe service, terribleThese people represent the UK! I have travelled with every other airline to Bangkok and back, British Airways is the worst.Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use it at allI quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending10 or more minutes in there \xe2\x80\x93 whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longerUneventful British Airways flight from Gatwick to PortoTake off delayed by 30 minutes due to French Air traffic control strike and route of flight had to be changed to avoid French airspaceThe flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at LondonWhat went wrong from the very beginning was the check in processWe had showed up early but was refused check in at Club EuropeThe ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abruptThe result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 \xe2\x80\x93 a larger than usual planeEventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kindSeating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy classBritish Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different \xe2\x80\x93 you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t properly enjoy itIt was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our endTo be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignmentsFurthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers thereHow is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens waschaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process)We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BAIn fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you getI also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket If we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy.I think that British Airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going, but that is their only achievementI am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the planehave not received any notification from BA to tell me they had changed the seatingNor have I received my money backI also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody didWhen I got home I gave BA one day to contact me but when they did not I submitted a complaint through their websiteI cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my moneyNeedless to say that none of these will ever be on British Airways.Poor woman was sick due to a bit of turbulence just before landing but the attendant dealt with it pefectlyAt that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distancesAt security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk backSecurity itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then takenWhen I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn\'t keep quietThe staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walkI had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn\'t careand saw mum as a nuisanceTo add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn\'t work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never gotMy mum refuses to fly BA again and if it wasn\'t for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and childrenI have complained to BA but as of yet no response.\r\n\r\nI am a gold executive club member and can confirm that I have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executiveChecked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would bein for an uncomfortable flightThe lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthyThe BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t access the clubrooms that were fullThe flight was late and chaoticThis resulted in my Wife being told they had run out of gin and tonicReturned home 10 days later and complainedCancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced - they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care soDomestic BA from London and Edinburgh return, check in at T5 a bit of a shambles the on line check in appeared down so pretty long quesReturn check in quick as was security again flight delayed 20 min boarding quick on to a new looking A319Awful experienceChanged our flight from a morning flight to an evening flight on the way out and refused to refund the difference as we were put on a cheaper flightThen cancelled our return flight without informing us so had to spend an hour of our final evening on holiday speaking to an advisorThe plane on the way out was very old, many TV\'s broken and very uncomfortableStaff are extremely unhelpful and will never use BA ever again.\r\nEvery flight we took in British Airways for our two vacation (4 flights) had huge problems! Always delayed, from NY a 5 hour delay in line! "Computer glitch, they wereAnother leg, check in was botched (their issue) and we had to stand with the very rude employee who botched it all up and kept trying to call his manager,who never picked up - for 30 minutes, which held up a very long line of check-insAlready a 1 hour delay, no explanation! Just read that British Airways had to turn a plane around this morning due to engine issues!On the 17th May I reviewed British Airways 777-200 flight from Bangkok to London which was not great with a 3/10 score givenThe food was ok but I think attention to detail is lacking to polish off this productOnly a minor negativeI would have been very disappointed indeed if I had paid a full fare for my business class ticketThe food was just appallingI could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course (beef) was hard, tasteless and very smalldecided to \'raid the larder\' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoidThe menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not availableThe FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheeseObviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayedApparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replacedNow I know \'stuff\' happens but let\'s not forget that we were departing from one of BA\'s home airports and why they couldn\'t have a second plane available quicker thanOverall, I would say not particularly favourablyHowever, with only one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passengers (versus 3 agents for business passengers) BA bag-drop in Geneva was a slow and painful experience and slowerIn-flight Staff were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast (of a ham and cheese croissant) could best be described as awful (a croissant in name only!)Given the price premium my overall opinion is that BA are not providing sufficiently better service in comparison to Easyjet considering the price premium between the two airlines.It was so small you had to squint most of the time to make out what was going on, and the resolution was terrible and irritated the eyesWe were also not allowed to have any sparkling wine, which is ridiculous as they have it on tap in Business classThe staff seemed irritated most of the time especially the lady in Business class who welcomed usVery disappointing experience.However, I\'ve also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that I have no interest in watchingThe lack of WiFi isn\'t a huge concern for meWhere BA falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awfulArrivals for BA at DXB is a bit of a nightmareI haven\'t flown BA for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddyA small gripe but it was quite annoyingAnother gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selectionI was on continental and Virgin a couple of years ago and don\'t believe I had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programmeHowever, there are just a few points that really bugs meI had mixed feelings about the Boeing 747 to Sao PauloThe headrests and recline were very good, however IFE was very outdated and limited, and because of the seat recline, hard to see the screenAlso personal space when the passanger in front was in full recline became almost claustophobicOutrageous red tapeFlight delayed to Glasgow so asked if I could go on the earlier flight (no baggage etc.) "Sorry madam, there are empty seats, but the time of sales has passedso we cannot put you on the earlier flight that leaves in 30 minutes"They delay a flight and won\'t switch you to an earlier flight that has space due to ridiculous red tapeThis isn\'t the first time that this has happenedWorst customer service ever - just pure lazinessUnfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospitalThe redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn\'t make our connecting flightBig mistakeHe also mentioned BA wasn\'t responsible for any onward travel costs." This is an outright lieI can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customersEither way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff givePoor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up.When I conducted online check-in I was informed that the flight will be one hour lateTerminal 7 at JFK is nothing excitingVery limited shopping/dining and not enough seatingThe hardware again is very dated - tiny screen, old seat and interiorThe food quality is nothing to write home aboutVery efficient and friendly crew with a very dated and unattractive productThe lounge lacks atmosphere and is very basic in my opinionThe hardware of this particular flight is sub standardVery old interior, worn carpet, dated toilet, and a small screen with poor resolutionIt\'s always let down by it\'s inferior hardware productThe food was not of high qualityI find this unacceptable for a full service airlines as I can even choose my seat with easyjetI used to prefer BA for its service and seat comfort but nowadays it seems that BA is no different than a budget airlineThe downside of this is you can get missed and in my case the cabin crew passed me at the meal service and I had to gesture to get themCabin crew were faultless, for example my wife asked for a Jasmine Tea and although this is not included in their selection the stewardess offered one of her one teabags!Only real disappointment was the IFE, the B777 aircraft are showing their age and the technology is dated, however the biggest problem is the video and audio selections which aevery inferior than many airlines.The seat was old, the footrest would not operate correctlyThe pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long timeThe food was probably the worst I\'ve ever experienced, the main meal comes from the Business Class menu, not sure what happened in the galley but the steak was likeconcrete, could not be eaten, hence left behind (noticed other passengers did the same)Light Meal prior to landing was inedible, a lasagna that just the look of it put me offHence left behind12hrs 30min flight the catering is very averageHowever, subsequent to the flight, British Airways has been positively nasty in their response, claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued (true enough)and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front-section when they were notThe fact that I received zero goods or services for my $118 beyond what I was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to themSuffice it to say that my wife and I will not be flying BA again.Premium Economy seat was ok but being close to galley was a bit annoying for the noiseIFE is so outdated now - tiny screen and very poor choice of music and only a few films worth watchingFood was so-soBritish Airways have seriously gone downhillThere is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - I would actually prefer easyjet and Ryanair as at least they are transparentThis journey from Lyon to London Heathrow was chaotic and stressfulThis means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even madeThe boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - I have honestly never seen anything like itOnce on board, they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn\'t fitPassengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people toThe meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwichAs always with BA flights to and from LHR, this flight was lateThe worst thing is BA\'s new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening 24 hours beforeThis means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay \xc2\xa312 just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom)BA\'s new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process)A shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low costI will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible.Flight was delayed 3 hours from Nassau to LondonNo refreshments offered while waiting2 hours waiting in the aircraft with no entertainment availableThen arrived in London with 3 hours delay, almost impossible to get information from rude staff at Heathrow airportThen it took over an hour to go through security and we almost missed our flightWhen we arrived bags had not arrived and were delivered home the following dayI won\'t be able to catch it)So I haven\'t taken my flight that I\'m kind of feeling I might be missing itNot very accommodating.But what a shame that otherwise British Airways business class seats badly need up-datingHowever this last trip has changed my mind and I will no longer fly with BAWe were given misprinted tickets for our connecting flight in LHR which led to us missing our flight - despite showing our tickets to several BA employeesThis caused even more confusion - at first it took us the wrong wayOf course when we finally found the correct gate the flight was already goneAnother woman in line behind us, had the same issue and missed the same flight for the same reasonWhen we did try to "follow it up" I was sent a response that was clearly cut and pasted with errors and typos and did not address the issue ofI tried to call a few times to speak to an agent in person, but ended up waiting for close to an hour and having to pay several eurosCustomer service was terrible and I can\'t imagine how it would have been if there was a more serious issueAside from this, the flights were cramped and the entertainment system was outdated - small screen with a poor selection and you have to hit your finger hard against theNot to mention, the beginning of our flight (way back) until after the food was served the system was out-of-orderThe last complaint is about the airline foodAs a vegetarian, normally I like BAs food but this time it was a jokeMy "special" meal consisted of considerably less food than my boyfriend who had the regular mealThe pasta was one of the worst I\'ve had on flight, and when breakfast came around, I got a recycled fruit cup from my dinner, while everyone else received afull box of food! It was so bad it was comical.The economy seat was a bit tight and the main niggle was the entertainment box at the base of the seat which hampered me from fully extended my legsAs a result, I had a swollen ankle as a result of the awkward position after this long flightCabin crew service was lacklustre and when I asked a passing crew to fill my water bottle, her reply was "I am busy right now" without offering any followupFood was unappetising and presentation was awfulEntertainment system was adequate but selection cant match what is offered by other competitors.\r\nSadly British Airways has gone downhillTo start, the plane was dirty, excessive hand luggage allowances meant delays to boarding, the food was awful, leg room was non existent (I\'m only 5\'6), subzero temperatures during theflight and an inadequate ratio of toilets to passengers left me very uncomfortableBut it\'s more a no frills airline/service and I\'d rather fly with easyjet any day.Check in was chaotic, and ground staff had no idea about check in, no information about lounge access, transfer etcSeat is usual economy seat, it\'s a joke they sell this product as business classNo entertainment and a disgraceful meal on business classOverall experience in this flight was no any better than economy class - it\'s a complete joke they call this product "business class" - you just waste your money.As a gold member I checked the First lounge, but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded tooBut the ground service was terrible - we were the first flight of the day and the clerks at the counter arrived to find 20-30 of us standing in queueThey got their stuff ready to work, sat in their chairs, then just sat their and ignored us for 15 minutes or soThe cabin crew didn\'t win any awards for friendliness either - they did their job but I won\'t say much moreThis was my second time flying British Airways, and I have not been impressed either timeI usually do not have a problem with British airways, but my flight from London Heathrow to Toronto on 23rd April was the worst flight I have been onThey said a 10 minute delay, which turned out to be a 6 hour delay, and they also kept changing the gate numberAnd on top of this our bags were lost along with 90% of the planesThis was very inconvenient as we have no clothes and arrived at 4:00am.The children didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat as they were fast asleep but the food was nothing special \xe2\x80\x93 supermarket ready meal standardLeg room was horrific and it truly felt like cattle classOn the return flight the seats were worn and old, screens were old and scratched the children weren\xe2\x80\x99t given their choice of meals as they had run out, my threeThe man sat next to me didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any food on a 7hr plus flight \xe2\x80\x93 he was vegetarian and they had run out of pastaFrom my experience I won\xe2\x80\x99t fly or recommend British airways anymoreThe days of glory are long gone.Having booked business class and paid the non refundable fee, British Airways would not let me check in on lineWhen I reached Terminal 5 they bumped me due to overbookingThey offered me a downgrade that I could not accept for health reasonsAs it was, I arrived 7 hours late and missed my meetingBritish Airways only cares about maximising its profitsIt cares nothing for its passengersFor many years I was a gold card holder and this is how they treat meThey sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after I had paid the full and non refundable fareNo longer! They are rapidly becoming the world\'s least favourite airlineAmsterdam to Hong Kong via London with British Airways turned out to be one of the most exhausting trips I have madeSeats were very uncomfortable, service was very poor, attendants rushed and food was horribleLeg space was poorThe cabin crew could not do enough to make my flight one I will not forgetFood was very average and was served at 11.30 am as a "lunch" - bland and uninterestingNairobi arrival was a nightmare as my electronic visa had a page not dowloaded and this resulted in an extra hour and a half with immigration before it was sortedIt was a night flight and they disappeared until 1 hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast - a pot of yoghurt and adreadful, dry cereal barBritish Airways needs to wake up and check what other airlines offer on the same flight.This however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that I\'m taking time to write this before we\'ve even completed our round trip with BritishAs I had got home late on April 16th from Cuba, I couldn\'t contact anyone until early morning of April 17th (my Fiance\'s birthday)Convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of itUpon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been "cancelled"We tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the17th and I follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sensetime, never one actually submittingShe put a note on our file that an agent from Jacksonville BA had cancelled our flights for no apparent reasonWe asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn\'t available to usball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, whichunfortunately still wouldn\'t get us the day we missed back)I am writing to complain about my deeply distressing British Airways flight from London Heathrow - Cape town with a change at JohannesburgThe flight was badly managed throughoutwhen I arrived at Heathrow, I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the systemShe eventually found it, She then said \'oh Im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight.\' I was obviously distressed by this as imaginedHowever we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airportOnce on the plane, again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that \'Sorry for the inconvenience, but BA did not have enough time toI think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy waitI was concerned about catching my next flight from Johannesburg to Cape TownHowever, this could not have been further from the truthtickets, and rudely shouted at me as to \'Why? did you leave your luggage\' By this point I had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmedShe then told us to \'just go back\' with no further helpOnce at the BA deskthey were not helpful in the slightestNo staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.Cancelled a British Airways flight to Gibraltar within cooling off period, they advised refund takes 24 hrsMany calls later still no refundAs of 15 April BA can\xe2\x80\x99t say when will be refundedBA don\xe2\x80\x99t care, holding \xc2\xa3353 and won\xe2\x80\x99t say when it will be refundedAppalling customer service and BA say if payment due on 17th April not made for replacement booking it will be cancelled and I will lose \xc2\xa3150 deposit despite the factthey are keeping \xc2\xa3353 of my money and have lied repeatedly as to when it will be refundedBA flights are now a nightmare, last 3 flights travelled on were delayed due to hand baggage only passengers marauding up and down the aisle trying to stuff oversize handluggage into overhead lockers with no care or consideration for other passengers possessionsCaptain had to announce unless people sat down and allowed hand baggage to be placed in hold, plane would be further delayedBritish Airways needs to decide whether it wants to be a no frills airline or not, it is now worse than Ryanair or EasyjetNot a pleasant experience to fly BA anymoreappreciate customer loyalty despite their recorded customer services message claiming they want to maintain high standards after travel and wish to ensure a passenger flies with BA again, they failThe in-flight entertainment system is also very out dated, pictures were not clear and colours were rather misleading.But the food is not very goodThe IFE was okay but the screen was small and it malfunctioned during part of the flight.Check in at Riyadh was terrible, broken baggage belts and staff explaining to passangers that there is an issue instead of fixing itLHR however was a disasterPriority Security took forever and the gate agent was even worsecheck in the trolley - worst of all was her attitude in thisI feel that her customer bashing behavior definitely did not comply with the BA image and expectations from businesses class passengersBritish Airways used to be better than thisI was very dismayed when he casually said "yes, about 1 hour 30 mins"I was very unhappy they had not told us earlier, or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely mannerFrom my experiences of BA business class in both long and short haul, over the past year, it is very sad to see that BA is focussing on making changeswhich make it more money, rather than changes which benefit the passenger experienceMy meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was, and it wasn\'t at all tastyIt is very irritating that British Airways pre-allocated me a middle seat, which I was not allowed to change when checking in online unless I paid 9 poundsAt the airport self service check in would not let me change seat either, so I had to find a customer service desk to get my preferred window seat, awaste of my time and theirsBut cabin crew clearly wished they were somewhere elseFollowing a not unexpected cancellation of our flight from Gatwick with Easyjet (they seem to be become more and more unreliable), we purchased tickets with BA from London CityThe aircraft was definitely not up to BA standards - old, very worn insideI really hope this is a temporary move on BA\'s part as this really is not the standard I have come to expect from them on this route.To make matters worse, the counter for lost baggage which operates on behalf of British Airways was very poorly markedTo make matters worse, they were talking to each other leaving my partner and I just awkwardly staring at them to complete their conversationWhatever 3rd party organisation which BA employs, are questionable.Staff are generally polite and hardworking, some are not very well trained, so seem to lack the extra attention to detail that should come with Club WorldThe fish main course served between IAD and LHR was unbelievably bad, but other meals were fairly goodHigh Tea without scones, clotted cream and strawberry jam is an absurd cost-cutting measure on a British airline, as I discovered on the LHR-IAD sectorIt is sad to see this airline not working harder in response to the competition.Seating was face-lifted economy class, and I think less comfortable than the older style we flew out on in an A319Flight was delayed due to French air traffic controllers being on strikeThe only real let down was the seatThis made the flight uncomfortable and difficult to sleepThis really let down what was a very good flight.BA\'s Club Europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in Economy, which may be okay for a quick hop to Paris, but is definitely unsatisfactory on thisIt was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1 - the only row with reasonable leg roomService was fine and the food quite good, but no entertainment at allYesterday our flight was cancelled due to snowAfter spending nearly an hour on hold to their \xe2\x80\x9cGold Card\xe2\x80\x9d premium service line we were told that all the flights are full so they cannot helpWe are \xe2\x80\x9cnot authorised to help with this on the telephone, you have to drive to the airport and ask (\xe2\x80\x9cbeg\xe2\x80\x9d) the airport staff to consider using a different carrierBA.com have been truly appallingThe email cancelling our flight did not even include a phone number to call for rebooking.I don\'t understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn outThe food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointmentIFE on both legs was pretty sad but I\'m not one for popular cultureFlights that require you to change planes in the Middle east or Europe fly over Africa and so tend to be very bumpy even at night when most convective activityGatwick to Amsterdam in Business class was truly the most uncomfortable flight of my lifeI thought that with British Airways I might expect something a little better - what a stupid mistake
