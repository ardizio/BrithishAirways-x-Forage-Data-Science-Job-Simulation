difference between business class and premium economy (which I never fly) is $3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is $6500 AUDThey owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 poundslie downThe already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage, there was no indication as to whom the carrier really wasThe crew were not BA but from an unknown charter companyand how, and our revised BA flight from LHR the following eveningThose who get on first fill the luggage bins with 2 bags, one of which is supposed to be small and under seat onlySubsequent passengers mill up and down the aisle, bumping into each other, searching for spaceAllocated the very back row next to the toilets and galleyWould have been better sitting in the luggage compartment.boardingWe had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to goingwas sat right down the bottom end of the flightWhen we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to comeOur airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in HeathrowEvery day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tagshours each way to collect our caseswe ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would beable to claim it all backIn future we will travel with one of the American carriers.One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantiveThere seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost -No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-offI was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too muchWe booked Club Europe months agoReturning Athens to London Club EuropeAfter that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutesI filled the form and gave to the employeeThey delivered the baggage three days laterWithout explanation, told everyone to go to a gateA passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bagsMany slept in a bus stop overnightCancelled our flight last-minute then moved us onto a flight 2 days later operated by Japan AirlinesWe had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as I am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the planeBecause it was operated by a different airline but booked by BA, neither BA nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being availableAfter 4 hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airportI did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in onlineI had a flight from Miami, Florida to Dublin, Ireland, via London\'s Heathrow airportThe total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure timeto DublinWhen we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closedThis was twenty minutes prior to departure timeThey ushered us to customer service to be rebookedGiven the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursedWe then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London\'s City AirportThe cab fare was roughly $500my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fareThis is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flightThe person who rebooked us, told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departureGiven the other feedback on this site, it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment.We started our day with BA in PragueWe purchased business class seatsAll they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business classto the many business class passengers who weren\xe2\x80\x99t being servedWe had a 4 hour delayI had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questionsAt one point there were no employees leftAnd there were no weather issuesI\xe2\x80\x99ve never experienced that beforeNot even a cup holder for my bottle of waterYou had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anythingIf I could give zero stars I would.My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you\xe2\x80\x99re flying with different connections and you have a tight scheduleanother flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that thereIt was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go homeThey gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the appfrom British Airways would help us I took the roomphoneMe and several other passengers spent the night in LondonBritish Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel (closest to our hotel) and told us that we can walk there if wewant toCheck in and security clearance very quick at LHR T5I was seated in 4 A, the Club Europe seats on the A320 seem to be getting smaller and legroom (I am 6ft)

International airport ready to check my bags in (I already checked-in online the previous evening so I had my boarding pass ready)No information was sent regarding this beforehandThe team at the check-in counter tried to get me on another flight that evening, but there were no flights availableThey did manage to get me another flight the following evening with Lufthansa to Italy via

the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting positionThe window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard forelderly to get out ofIf you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a

They then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me back on the first flight that they had rebooked me on -They re-routed me from LAX to JFK to LHR - which I would have accepted - but they booked the journey in Economy (LAX to JFK) which my husband (6\'4"to LHRMy partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to FrankfurtWhen we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.gMr John Smith and Ms John Smith)Trusting BA\'s staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticketImmediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA\'s \'Commercial Change Booking Team\' and informed them of our situationThe service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small feeHe offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Supportto do soI told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be deniedfrom claiming the cost of the new ticketHe said no, I could claim the differenceWhen ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people didAfter this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait againSo after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS isthe wayThe crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely areand avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernailsLounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours beforecrew appeared with food sales and the "free water" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.Easyjet who do two service runs etc.Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airportUltimately told to file complaintwhat the front end of the plane gets!faultBA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your ownNo arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport, Finally managed to get the legal minimum \xc2\xa3520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused tomy journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeksin loyalty and aren\'t bothered about your businessI would stick with another airline.My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 yearsI am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by nameThe second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraftThey gave us a menu, asked what we\xe2\x80\x99d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we liketo choose something elseWe take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no availAs a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year eachchecking in and in the lounges when we use them.Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economyEven though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classesIn Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New ZealandOn my return journey my final flight was from London to EdinburghMy only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost \xc2\xa3265.07Since Nov 22, ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA in an attempt to have my money returnedI finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of \xc2\xa332.14I have asked for an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correctI tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself.24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-inSeats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of fourThe economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in frontclamber past the reclined backrest in front of meIf they can do it, then why not British Airways.booking only to discover the only way I could fly the next day was by paying business classAirport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiencyLuggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time.Flight fineIn-line with competitorsPleasant crewOnly niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at HeathrowIt seems like this is standard for the Berlin flightsWould use again.Came from Glasgow to London and took connecting flight American Airlines from London to North CarolinaLuggage are still in Glasgow.of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flightWe contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flightsThe call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings dueI had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refundedin the way of inflight entertainmentYou have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFiNot that I have anything against that - I\'m used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticketI would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the priceOn board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two andAnd for the flyers who don\'t want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a \'premium economy\' option and really make adifference for the experienceI used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it\'s a case of flying budget, or flyingbudget for double the price with BA.After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after meWhen attempting to collect my luggage, mine was the only one not to arriveI sought help and was informed to make a claim onlineFor a month, I have been back and forth to British Airways, yet they stated it is not their fault.My Luggage arrived at LHR as planned on Saturday 6/24to solve the problem.They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to theUSNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to meWe booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business ClassWhen we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transferThe same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airportWe discovered we had been marked as \xe2\x80\x9cno-shows\xe2\x80\x9d for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still activeWe were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the websiteaccommodated due to the ticketing rulesThey did not state how many creditsThere are no boarding drinks providedOn arrival at Bodrum my bags were among the last to appearYou can buy sandwiches and crisps but don\'t expect a hot mealBecause the plane is a narrow body , there are no screensThis is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to IbizaA very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolleyExcept, don\'t fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for \xc2\xa3100+ in each direction, as I did(I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished infour abreastThe meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your \xc2\xa3100Oh wellApp and website user experience is years behind other airlinesTravelled to Heathrow to Kalamata and return journey 11 days laterWorld Traveller (aka Economy) Classcaught a motorway closureCan only recommend if you are not tall.this was a BA holidayHeathrowAs there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday eveningI would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEAThe crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on theirairlinesWe were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us homeIt extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as wellNo offers of compensation or upgrades were madeflight we were never planning onI flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seatFinally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gateWe were traveling as a family (5 people)The lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding passBecause we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder)We only didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the partyNo text messageNo phoneWaiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight optionHang on?

Gatwick to DocklandsAll I get is someone in IndiaI thought i was flying Iberia once I looked close at ticket it was British AirwaysThe rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my TV was so close I couldn\'t focus on itcurtains.I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through HeathrowAdditionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assistother customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available)When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car deskWe found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotelAfter running through the Heathrow airport and going through security againAfter begging they found us a flight on another airlineAt that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with DeltaWe were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delayIn total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound eachWe were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with themAs I said to both of them todaymemories and stuff that I have in thereMy husband and I booked seats within our premium economy bookingOn both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served foodEach time they had run out of our choicesOn all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy foodMay 3, flew from Seattle to Heathrow then to EdinburghI had tee times at two courses in StAndrews that took months to makeThe promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expensesI contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletriesThey rebooked me on the same flightI went through three flights to reach my destinationinvolved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing todo with the previously addressed complaintsWe were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connectingflightWhen we arrived at Barcelona airport, we discovered that our check in luggage was still in LondonDespite having a layover of approximately 2.5 hours, I ended up waiting until 4.30 pm

the first class lineMy itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Veniceconnecting flight to VeniceWhen I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphletAfter waiting to be connected to a BA repI spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I wouldhave to call themExpedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the repsaid the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a FridayBusy day at LHR and flight fullLounge crowded but B gates lounge quieterEarly arrival, quick

not a connecting flightI asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at HeathrowQuick security checkOnce onboard quick flight up to Glasgow, water and snack providedThe flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business classstandards rather than bean countingclass ticket was one of the more expensive on recent tripsPaid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from HeathrowI went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowdedBeing 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offeringWe subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 minsThere did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of legroomIt would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flightof timeThis was also during an industrial action at Heathrow, meaning the number of flights were limitedpassenger is already there at the airport.\r\nThe flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never isSo ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flightCould have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactiveInstead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BABusiness class fare should offer more.on thisFlying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggageonlyTrying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seatsThis meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of foodI booked business class tickets for my fianc\xc3\xa9 and Ibooking to feesLess than 1% of my booking costsFirst, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economyThe seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in halfto the toilet, which wakes up that passengerThe whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of youFourth, the toilet was tinyThe second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisleThis means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seatTo book a seat before check in is $170I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats leftto get through the day beforeto SpainAll the staff members repeat the same mantra - \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours\xe2\x80\x9d as if that would make the situationAll of them are better suited to working away from other humans.All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacyThere is ample storage and USB charging portsAs someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I\'ve been able to get a few minutes sleep here and thereNo slippers, only a pair of socksBeyond meal times there was offer of water during the flightI had to go and find an attendant and askDifferent customers seem to receive a different quality of serviceA customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etcI had risotto while my partner had chickenSummary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haulIf there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me mybag was left behindI gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact meand my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of daysI told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fineAt the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayedat, even though I had given them an updated addressI asked them what I should to since I was flying home nowThe guy at the counter told me that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his problem and that I should figure it out myselfI questioned him about his response and he just walked awayA manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either myflight or the next oneI came home and a couple of days later I received my bagconversationsIt took us 2 hours just to go from T5 to T3 and clear security checkSeats in Premium economy was ok, but when the passenger in front reclines, there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross overThey changed our Flights from Brussels to London Heathrow to LAX on 4/16/2023Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep therea $600+ flighttake the loss.Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return legTo ensure the passengers didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nutsThe cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything else for 12 hours you know!\xe2\x80\x9d the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies soI paid \xc2\xa311 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptopLHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through securityWhile BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of theBreakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standardI wouldn\'t mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre CovidBreakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was\xc2\xa0the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flightPriority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handlingSo if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshotsAnd, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDFI booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London HeathrowThe whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was IberiaOn Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fogUpon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken offThe British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursedHowever when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn\'t their problem and that it was Iberia\'s problemresponsibility for itLate take off, no gate when we arrivedThe boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the planeBut more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really business classThere were a few aisles \xe2\x80\x94not separated in any way\xe2\x80\x94in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits thereI believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action that week.I was a few rows in.After several delays and canceled flights, we finally made it to Copenhagen on American Airlines and British Airways flightsI had to buy new luggage in DenmarkNot sure how that happenedI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpfulWhen walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go backto seatI have flown with BA for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were getting betterOn the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimalI was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortableYou can pay less if you just want short term simple messagingCatering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really enoughEven the baggage was super quick at coming throughdayWe flew an older 787 with the old style club seatsWe were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisleFood seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched itWe went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast trackscamOnce this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding passAt the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotelThe transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airportWhen we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30that was a rushIt appeared more of a Motel than an hotelstaff to change my roomAfter some discussion, they agreed to change itI went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupiedI asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.Was given a miniscule amount of water, small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machineswere u/sWhen I said this should be complimentary, girl said it was not her problem and walked away.Flight took off late, cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzelsArrived at Heathrow late, put on a remote stand, loaded onto buses to terminalFlew from London Heathrow to MarrakechI had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with 2/3 bags and some with hand luggage that was obviously too bigI was meant to fly in January to AlgeriaI paid over \xc2\xa3300 for the ticketI had to then rebook it in March and pay another \xc2\xa3100Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of \xc2\xa380(Tax only)We have flown repeatedly with British Airways and the One World alliance over the last few weeksFinally, our luggage arrived in Puerto Rico with a 3-day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip ..we haven\'t received any information about our luggage to this day, luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there Wir sind in den letzten Wochen immer wieder mit Britisch Airways und dem One World Zusammenschluss geflogenJeder Flug war versp\xc3\xa4tetNun sitzen wir wieder in Miami am Flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive Versp\xc3\xa4tung sodass wir unseren Anschlussflug verpassen werdenZuletzt ist auch unser Gep\xc3\xa4ck mit 3 Tagen Versp\xc3\xa4tung in Puerto Rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren Rundreise umplanen\xe2\x80\xa6 wir haben bis heute noch keine Info \xc3\xbcber unser Gep\xc3\xa4ck erhalten,zum Gl\xc3\xbcck haben wir selbst am Flughafen nachgesehen und es war da\xe2\x80\xa6 Beim letzten verpsp\xc3\xa4teten Flug meinte die Kabinen Crew dass auch sie ihre Anschlussfl\xc3\xbcge verpassen und wir im selbenFlugzeug sitzen und sie k\xc3\xb6nnen nichts machen.The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclinedyou have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of youI will now have to see if I can change themboard.Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours serviceFirst time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrowmy next flightMy luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the islandI was staying onFinally go up front and the BA agent let 4 supposed VIPS with 12-14 large to-be-checked bags in front of all of usWe are done with BA.Booked a flight return flight between London and Munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in DecemberThe return flight was cancelled and re-booked from 3/17 to 3/12Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasionsEach time needing to find a helpful representativeBritish Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticketThrough repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15It was intact those daysOn 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was goneThere are no BA representative at the Munich AirportStaff need customer training, better knowledge of their product, and some mannersOn arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as2 hoursas you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to boardI understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA givenmost people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alonePro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airportWe did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on timeAlso we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that eveningAll the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flighttake offbut it\'s by no measure good, just the least bad optionIf I could give a minus rating, I wouldSupposed to be LHR-AMS at 14.05 on 13th MarchOnly halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA\'s fault)Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it isof a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmedThe 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to RotterdamReturn from AMS-LHR, similar storyQuickly check app, and confirmed it wasDesk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flightAvoid unless you have no other option, and even then stop and consider if you \'really\' need to go.We were flying World Traveller Plus their Premium serviceWhat it was not was PremiumBA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costsEven though I booked through to DublinAnother hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring itWe had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughterWe received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow expressI\xe2\x80\x99d booked a day of holiday off work for this tripWe ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington insteadOn the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BAI believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a scriptWe often received the response similar to \xe2\x80\x98computer says no\xe2\x80\x99When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up- BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destinationOur original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00Salzburg- The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in deskNo emailNo textThe check in person said I should get on the app to rebookWe were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958)formerWe did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the planeI had a business class flight scheduled on Dec 12 2022 \xe2\x80\xa6 Manchester > Copenhagen -Bangkok and return flight Dec 27 2022 \xe2\x80\xa6 Bangkok > Stockholm > ManchesterSAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being \xe2\x80\xa6 Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > BangkokI returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BAWe arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had goneEmirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issuedI then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim thefunds back laterI paid \xc2\xa31279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > BangkokWhilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward tomy Bangkok address the following dayI arrived back home yesterday and was informed by BA that they have found my bag in London.O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidanceIt took around 40 minutes to find someoneWe were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights inLondon etcEven though, I booked and paid for the ticketsSo, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 timesThere was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some officeEventually, it finally go through to themI have now chased up the reimbursement four timesEach time they tell me it has been sent and to be patientToday they tell me that they need to check my account detailsSo, again, I send them the same information that I have done beforeAND I wait patiently for my reimbursementWe are flying Business class for most of our flight and then Premium economy for the balanceIn addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional $225/pp for our seatsNow BA is changing planes, they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas (my wife & I) when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one ofus additional $$ to be re-seated next to each otherI am in Australia and on Friday night, went online to book a flight from Heathrow to Malpensa (Milan)I did not realise that when I specifically searched for flights to Malpensa it offered options to other airports in MilanWhen I received my itinerary by email, it was to another airport in Milanthe 24 hour cooling off periodApparently as the ticket was issued in the UK, I needed to contact themAt 7.54 am on the day of travel whilst driving to London Heathrow I received an email advising my flight had been

once home and sent in my complaintsThey responded with a $100 pound voucher for our group.The A380 still has the rather strange configuration in Club World where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite positionThe welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantryService was friendly but rather slow, no spontaneous refills of drinks

fullSome space in overhead binsSeat and legroom okFlight itself was ok, landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground crewBA still seems to believe it is something special, a premium carrierThe reality is that it is notThe only reason we flew BA was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last yearBA is our carrier of last choice.As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre inSouth AfricaI made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelledThe same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to \xe2\x80\x9cgo online to rebook your seat\xe2\x80\x9dI called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centredo with IBERIAI returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happenedThe man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutesHe gave me a \xc2\xa330 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airlineOnce aboard my new flight the service was minimalOther than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was availableThis was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flightBA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.The second flight was operated by Qatar Airways this was from Doha to IslamabadBA 242 on the 6/2/23Not only my first flight in 17 years, but also my first time back to England for 17

BA HolidaysI tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get helpThe first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn\'t know that, she gave us a number to call and toldus that she couldn\'t do anything else, that we had to call that numberWe called the number, which was asking us to call another number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm,She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message thatThey didn\'t charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to MadridOrganised boarding processQuick drink and a snackOutward journey BA245 London to Buenos

team for British Airways to make the changeOn the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry callcancel the ticket and rebook itI was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbersI accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the bookingI insisted I would need to know the total of the refundIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly \xc2\xa39.00This is despite the seat not be abandonedAccording to BA policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3%

He wasreally accommodating and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big dealand you made me fly with Air Lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier.I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expectsome form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggagewas told it was a short haul fightMy sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as aUSB port to charge their phonesBA I now realise stands for Budget AirlineFlew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777Zero roomNo post take off drinks/snacks offered Meal was sent out after a couple of hoursChicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their lifeStale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?!

I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to LondonSo I opted for the refund thinking I\'d get a full refundrefundwhat I paidSo instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .this is the reason they gave in an email"Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensationFurther to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked afterby our support teamWe take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decisionBelfast to London on 20 Jun, 0650I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same dayThe reply was \xe2\x80\x9cit is the customer\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to contact the airline, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing we can do\xe2\x80\x9dI was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and salesFor the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another numberOnboard the aircraft, when I approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, I was told that it\xe2\x80\x99s the customer\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to do it on theirown I would think twice to take BA in the future.Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA\'s low quality customer serviceI guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&CoGood old times of being a glamour flying BA has far goneGround force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and waterFor the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternativeThis a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delaysMinuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats acrossEach pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage spacetheir flights to the Far East and Australasia.Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departureThe benefit of low cost airlines is they they don\'t hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over thisInflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad optionswere availableI thought good, that is probably my luggageThis was a risk I was well aware about when travelling to Greece for my weddingThe most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag\xe2\x80\x99s location, the man on thephone verbatim stated: \xe2\x80\x9cand if I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9dAfter this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was \xe2\x80\x9cnot his problem\xe2\x80\x9d, before saying \xe2\x80\x9chold\xe2\x80\x9d and not taking me off holdor communicationMeal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when I last flown with BA - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfastLHR to SFO in new Club SuiteRather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengersFood adequate and still served on the same traystorage compartments where empty when I entered the planeFeels like BA are putting the \'economy\' back in \'premium economy\'A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew \'could come back later\' if you wantedsomething else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn\'t leap at this offer given how long it took them to do foodI\'ve never experienced this on other airlines\' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to youWater eventually came round after we\'d eatenLoos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very backThe upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quicklyBA\'s problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why

thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours.After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn\'t as the voucher had been usedTwo years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my recordI then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematicOne phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working daysI then chased when it was long overdueI was then told it will be with me in 21 working daysI try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are availablethis was BA policySo then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was

that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, howevershe was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my rowAfter a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seatSoon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find itI would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did notThe premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg restI booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to

help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flightis going to Edinburgh, not GlasgowWe booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from AustraliaBeverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entreesI wouldn\'t mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now veryCrew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain

half an hour or soThis was no big dealWith the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcomingIn the event take off was permitted quite soon afterThe crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main coursesA drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinnerand my husband had another half glass of champagneDinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumblerwe had hit some mild turbulenceThe flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signsof being awakeCoffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on requestindividual itemsFor the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% ofthe price paid for the premium cabinThe staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between mealsThis is so different to every other airline we have used in the pastAfter 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a

economical with the truthWe flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterdayMadeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in onlineThere were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellersI went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were comingOne blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a deskAnother man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t simply worked at the desks from the beginningThen we

usually around 1 hour into the flight3.5 hours after take off they served out foodFood was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you\'d expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be goodSo overall very medium experience.One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine artI last flew with

but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, asare both the centre seatsWe were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubbleYou cannot see other passengersIt was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table downIn most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everythingWe were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you areclimbing over your partner\'s legs, not some strangerany reasonstravel again this year at all.I have a flight booked for January 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was

bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rulesLondon to ParisI wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishingI think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in FirstBut it\'s quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabinThe former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussyto have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!)still plenty of time for sleepBut the soup was cold, and the main wouldn\'t have been out of place in business classMoreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; hadI known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the planeThe cabin layout and bed: well, it\'s easy to find details of this elsewhere onlineOverall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I havea shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?)Amman to LondonWe are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flightMeals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - thisWhen I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in itI had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs)It turns out that the so called \'vegan meal\' had milk and egg in itShortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a veganwas said "oh I don\'t think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and askof getting rid of usPaphos to London Gatwick in Club EuropeWe checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we couldpay!

I was told to consult the BA app the following morningBA\'s app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days totalI guess I\'ll be trying out their call centre in the morningWe all understand that adverse weather happensMoreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airportsfor BA excuse"I\'ve had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn\'t have handled it betterThey really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business.Aberdeen to Abu Dhabi via LondonDespite being a Gold Member of the Executive Club I try to avoid British Airways these days and now I\'ve reminded myself whyThey walk up and down the aisle without making eye contactPrague to Denver via LondonFlight to Heathrow was average, what you expect from a 2 hour flightAt Heathrow the security lasted me  30 minutesWhen I boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room, it was less than the flight beforeSeville to GatwickLondon to AmsterdamGatwick to Barcelona No priority boarding for business passengersI thought it time BA deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these daysThe new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no ideawhat was going on -

that in JanuaryWe got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone elseI asked whyThe BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changedShe then said we should have got there earlierI was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat costThe flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of

cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served orshould I say offered some sort of filled rollSingapore to LondonThe same comments for that review apply hereThe IFE is a work of mystery in terms of contentThose who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to seeIFE is one thing on long haulThe other is food and beverageOn Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizzaor sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etcAt the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuitsThe A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as suchThe BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowlsBA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to anotherI came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments applySydney to London via SingaporeIt has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hoursLast year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlinesNearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American AirlinesA B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frameBoarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into SingaporeNo menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas)The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheapKFC offers a better grade of plasticThe food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over saltyQantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessertDrinks?

several times in the past, but not for a number of yearsYou pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etcIt is said to be 31" but seemed like lessAlso, on the Washington  to LHR

one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on theoriginal time in case there wouldn\'t be a delayIn the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delayBaggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politenessThe aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already hadOn the window and aisle seats, there\'s also the IFE box so there\'s no place for both feetWhen I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legsWe\'ve got our

our bags, hands them to us and says "I\'m sorry but the space is needed forlarge bags", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of usReducing our leg room to zeroI had to stand in the back

yes, price reduced - no! The 777\'s in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tinyWhat these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon!

adding an extra 50 seats to these planesOn our flight to Tokyo Narita from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were \'limited\'To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would likeThis is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabinFor breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first servedWe spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comesat their peril.No pre-meal drink offeredLimited selection of drinks, with wine

was second in priority)After a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the planeOur flight from Heathrow to Bergen was only an hour and 40, but I spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew memberThe safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew- "Cabin crew, seats for landing"The captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat withthe said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with \'that landing\'The free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, I\'d rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airlinePerhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to makeLondon Heathrow to Seoul returnI booked my return flights back in January when BA were having their annual sale for around \xc2\xa31700Thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around

limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortableThe pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduledWe eventually disembarked at 14:45 which meant I had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaimBy the time I had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 15:15 and the gate was closing in 10 minsTalked to BA customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the IOM (where I live) from London City but they could only book me on the

mountingFortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precariousPush back and departure was exactly on timeWithin a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strangeUnlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point thatsome of them were literally running down the aislesI can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possibleTo be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and I almost expected them to say \'Ientitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night)

one of your One World partners, they tell their customers if their luggage follows them during transitI would go as far as to say I would choose them over Virgin now unless there was a dramatic price

So I was hoping to have had time to eat before the flightThere were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queuesI felt I was flying with a low cost airlinealerts were indicating departure at 10.22 instead of the planned departure at 10.00I doubt that this was only known at that timeWhy wasn\'t there an update before? Anyway, new departure time scheduled for 11.59We only started boarding at 11.00Then, inside the cabin, we waited for another hour until taking offAt no point did BA offer vouchersWe only ate inside the cabin after 2amA few years ago you could actually (slowly) save miles, nowadays, you get almost nothingI paid almost \xc2\xa3300 to fly from London to FrankfurtThe flight took off and then was re-routed back to London because of weather and German air space closingWhich was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare London heatwaveI complained to their customer service team and after a lot of back and forth, they offered a 20 pound travel voucherThis was a 4 hour flight by the waypolicy was introduced last spring)Will they be selling lottery tickets next?

The cabin staff told me it was the new policy, and thatif we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles! There were not even any sandwiches for sale! Fortunately forus soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and I noticed she was carrying a sandwich, I asked her where shehad got it, and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it!

Once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay.Flew British Airways from New York JFK to London HeathrowAfter a hiatus of almost 20 years, the Heathrow to Inverness route was reinstated in May 2016its budget rival when travelling to the North of ScotlandBag-Drop; I checked-in online so just had to go through bag-dropthan I have recently experienced with Easyjet in Geneva Boarding in Geneva was fairly smooth, no better or worse than EasyjetFlew with British Airways on a 7 hour flight from Dubai to London in Economy with the tiniest TV screen I have seen in the last 10 yearsThe screen had little crosses in itThis must have been an ancient planeThe movie selection was old given that I watched the same movies 2 months earlierNothing that is currently in the cinemaWe only had one meal and when we asked for additional food there were only snacks in form of chocolate bars and biscuits\r\nGoing against the grain somewhat I have to say that I truly prefer flying with British Airways over Emirates on the London Heathrow -

for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flightThis on top of the steep fare charged for travel in Business ClassI don\xe2\x80\x99t begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactics as described inorder to further maximize profitability, I rebel.Amsterdam to Sao Paulo via London Heathrow with British AirwaysLondon City to Glasgow with British AirwaysOther airlines let you fly standby except for British AirwaysAnytime I have the option, I will be flying a different airline.My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to GoaWhen we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when wedisembarkedOn this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to doThey advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to GoaWhen we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 daysbefore making a claim through the websiteSince returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursementHere is the reply we received from BA customer relations: "We\'ve received a reply from Mumbai who\'ve investigated your caseThe agent you spoke to can\'t specifically remember speaking to you personallyHe did mention he\'d advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangementsI was scheduled to be on BA 114 from JFK to LHR on 17th of MayIt feels like a LCC terminalThe flight left JFK with a minor delayAs it\'s a light flight most passengers were sleepingOverall it\'s a typical BA flightIt took me less than 30 minutes to leave the airplane, travel from T5C to T5A, clear immigration and collect luggage.British Airways from London Heathrow to New York JFK on a Boeing 747 which hasn\'t been refittedUsed the BA Galleries lounge in T5A (South)It was busy with very limited food choice during breakfast, although the wine selection was decentEntertainment provided was very limited and not as what\'s being advertised on the websiteAmenity pack provided is also very basicIn a way I felt I was on Premium Economy of some Asian airlinesA full service after take off and an afternoon tea before landingI will always prefer to fly Asian airlines.Flew British Airways London Heathrow to Warsaw for a long weekendDeparture from LHR T3 was smooth although the terminal is crowded and datedReturn 3 days later with a delay of an hourA small pack of food and a full bar service was providedPlanes were clean and have the refitted interiorSeat pitch was extremely tight -
